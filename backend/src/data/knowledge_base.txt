LiveKit Voice AI Agents - Knowledge Base

LiveKit is a powerful platform for building real-time voice and video applications.

Key Features:
- Real-time voice AI agents with natural conversation capabilities
- Support for multiple LLM providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, and others
- Integration with various Speech-to-Text (STT) providers like AssemblyAI, Deepgram
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) support with providers like Cartesia, ElevenLabs, OpenAI
- Advanced turn detection for natural conversation flow
- Background noise cancellation
- Metrics and logging for production monitoring

Voice AI Pipeline Components:
1. Speech-to-Text (STT): Converts user speech to text
2. Large Language Model (LLM): Processes text and generates responses
3. Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts LLM responses to speech
4. Voice Activity Detection (VAD): Detects when users are speaking
5. Turn Detection: Determines when to respond

LiveKit Cloud offers hosted infrastructure for running voice AI agents at scale.
Agents can be deployed using Docker containers and run in production environments.

The platform supports both voice pipeline mode and realtime model mode (like OpenAI Realtime API).
