The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next\nLarry Page or Sergey Brin won\u2019t make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won\u2019t create a\nsocial network. If you are copying these guys, you aren\u2019t learning from them.\nOf course, it\u2019s easier to copy a model than to make something new. Doing what we already know\nhow to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But every time we create\nsomething new, we go from 0 to 1. The act of creation is singular, as is the moment of creation, and\nthe result is something fresh and strange.\nUnless they invest in the difficult task of creating new things, American companies will fail in the\nfuture no matter how big their profits remain today. What happens when we\u2019ve gained everything to\nbe had from fine-tuning the old lines of business that we\u2019ve inherited? Unlikely as it sounds, the\nanswer threatens to be far worse than the crisis of 2008. Today\u2019s \u201cbest practices\u201d lead to dead ends;\nthe best paths are new and untried.\nIn a world of gigantic administrative bureaucracies both public and private, searching for a new\npath might seem like hoping for a miracle. Actually, if American business is going to succeed, we are\ngoing to need hundreds, or even thousands, of miracles. This would be depressing but for one crucial\nfact: humans are distinguished from other species by our ability to work miracles. We call these\nmiracles technology.\nTechnology is miraculous because it allows us to do more with less, ratcheting up our fundamental\ncapabilities to a higher level. Other animals are instinctively driven to build things like dams or\nhoneycombs, but we are the only ones that can invent new things and better ways of making them.\nHumans don\u2019t decide what to build by making choices from some cosmic catalog of options given in\nadvance; instead, by creating new technologies, we rewrite the plan of the world. These are the kind\nof elementary truths we teach to second graders, but they are easy to forget in a world where so much\nof what we do is repeat what has been done before.\nZero to One is about how to build companies that create new things. It draws on everything I\u2019ve\nlearned directly as a co-founder of PayPal and Palantir and then an investor in hundreds of startups,\nincluding Facebook and SpaceX. But while I have noticed many patterns, and I relate them here, this\nbook offers no formula for success. The paradox of teaching entrepreneurship is that such a formula\nnecessarily cannot exist; because every innovation is new and unique, no authority can prescribe in\nconcrete terms how to be innovative. Indeed, the single most powerful pattern I have noticed is that\nsuccessful people find value in unexpected places, and they do this by thinking about business from\nfirst principles instead of formulas.\nThis book stems from a course about startups that I taught at Stanford in 2012. College students can\nbecome extremely skilled at a few specialties, but many never learn what to do with those skills in\nthe wider world. My primary goal in teaching the class was to help my students see beyond the tracks\nlaid down by academic specialties to the broader future that is theirs to create.

Actually, it\u2019s very hard to answer. It\u2019s\nintellectually difficult because the knowledge that everyone is taught in school is by definition agreed\nupon. And it\u2019s psychologically difficult because anyone trying to answer must say something she\nknows to be unpopular. Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius.\nMost commonly, I hear answers like the following:\n\u201cOur educational system is broken and urgently needs to be fixed.\u201d\n\u201cAmerica is exceptional.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no God.\u201d\nThose are bad answers. The first and the second statements might be true, but many people already\nagree with them. The third statement simply takes one side in a familiar debate. A good answer takes\nthe following form: \u201cMost people believe in x, but the truth is the opposite of x.\u201d I\u2019ll give my own\nanswer later in this chapter.\nWhat does this contrarian question have to do with the future? In the most minimal sense, the future\nis simply the set of all moments yet to come. But what makes the future distinctive and important isn\u2019t\nthat it hasn\u2019t happened yet, but rather that it will be a time when the world looks different from today.\nIn this sense, if nothing about our society changes for the next 100 years, then the future is over 100\nyears away. If things change radically in the next decade, then the future is nearly at hand. No one can\npredict the future exactly, but we know two things: it\u2019s going to be different, and it must be rooted in\ntoday\u2019s world.

That progress can take one of two\nforms. Horizontal or extensive progress means copying things that work\u2014going from 1 to n.\nHorizontal progress is easy to imagine because we already know what it looks like. Vertical or\nintensive progress means doing new things\u2014going from 0 to 1. Vertical progress is harder to imagine\nbecause it requires doing something nobody else has ever done. If you take one typewriter and build\n100, you have made horizontal progress. If you have a typewriter and build a word processor, you\nhave made vertical progress.\nAt the macro level, the single word for horizontal progress is globalization\u2014taking things that\nwork somewhere and making them work everywhere. China is the paradigmatic example of\nglobalization; its 20-year plan is to become like the United States is today. The Chinese have been\nstraightforwardly copying everything that has worked in the developed world: 19th-century railroads,\n20th-century air conditioning, and even entire cities. They might skip a few steps along the way\u2014\ngoing straight to wireless without installing landlines, for instance\u2014but they\u2019re copying all the same.\nThe single word for vertical, 0 to 1 progress is technology. The rapid progress of information\ntechnology in recent decades has made Silicon Valley the capital of \u201ctechnology\u201d in general.

For example, 1815 to 1914 was a period of both rapid\ntechnological development and rapid globalization. Between the First World War and Kissinger\u2019s\ntrip to reopen relations with China in 1971, there was rapid technological development but not much\nglobalization. Since 1971, we have seen rapid globalization along with limited technological\ndevelopment, mostly confined to IT.\nThis age of globalization has made it easy to imagine that the decades ahead will bring more\nconvergence and more sameness. Even our everyday language suggests we believe in a kind of\ntechnological end of history: the division of the world into the so-called developed and developing\nnations implies that the \u201cdeveloped\u201d world has already achieved the achievable, and that poorer\nnations just need to catch up.\nBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. My own answer to the contrarian question is that most people think the\nfuture of the world will be defined by globalization, but the truth is that technology matters more.\nWithout technological change, if China doubles its energy production over the next two decades, it\nwill also double its air pollution. If every one of India\u2019s hundreds of millions of households were to\nlive the way Americans already do\u2014using only today\u2019s tools\u2014the result would be environmentally\ncatastrophic. Spreading old ways to create wealth around the world will result in devastation, not\nriches. In a world of scarce resources, globalization without new technology is unsustainable.\nNew technology has never been an automatic feature of history. Our ancestors lived in static, zero-\nsum societies where success meant seizing things from others. They created new sources of wealth\nonly rarely, and in the long run they could never create enough to save the average person from an\nextremely hard life. Then, after 10,000 years of fitful advance from primitive agriculture to medieval\nwindmills and 16th-century astrolabes, the modern world suddenly experienced relentless\ntechnological progress from the advent of the steam engine in the 1760s all the way up to about 1970.\nAs a result, we have inherited a richer society than any previous generation would have been able to\nimagine.\nAny generation excepting our parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019, that is: in the late 1960s, they expected", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2414, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f710be0-0c55-4d37-809f-1da5554b1f7a": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f710be0-0c55-4d37-809f-1da5554b1f7a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 160, "file_path": "src/data/zero-to-one.pdf", "source": "11", "chapter": "Zero To One: The Future Of Progress", "chapter_title": "Zero To One: The Future Of Progress", "page_number": "11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e8a3f2e2-c068-498f-97b1-3d4ceee166d8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"total_pages": 160, "file_path": "src/data/zero-to-one.pdf", "source": "11", "chapter": "Zero To One: The Future Of Progress", "chapter_title": "Zero To One: The Future Of Progress", "page_number": "11"}, "hash": "01dac731655ec94dcda0cc6b661611927dcb1d41566d5fc41791455c3d4b91e2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "this progress to continue.

We tend to remember them as a prosperous, optimistic decade that\nhappened to end with the internet boom and bust. But many of those years were not as cheerful as our\nnostalgia holds. We\u2019ve long since forgotten the global context for the 18 months of dot-com mania at\ndecade\u2019s end.\nThe \u201990s started with a burst of euphoria when the Berlin Wall came down in November \u201989. It\nwas short-lived. By mid-1990, the United States was in recession. Technically the downturn ended in\nMarch \u201991, but recovery was slow and unemployment continued to rise until July \u201992. Manufacturing\nnever fully rebounded. The shift to a service economy was protracted and painful.\n1992 through the end of 1994 was a time of general malaise. Images of dead American soldiers in\nMogadishu looped on cable news. Anxiety about globalization and U.S. competitiveness intensified\nas jobs flowed to Mexico. This pessimistic undercurrent drove then-president Bush 41 out of office\nand won Ross Perot nearly 20% of the popular vote in \u201992\u2014the best showing for a third-party\ncandidate since Theodore Roosevelt in 1912. And whatever the cultural fascination with Nirvana,\ngrunge, and heroin reflected, it wasn\u2019t hope or confidence.\nSilicon Valley felt sluggish, too. Japan seemed to be winning the semiconductor war. The internet\nhad yet to take off, partly because its commercial use was restricted until late 1992 and partly due to\nthe lack of user-friendly web browsers. It\u2019s telling that when I arrived at Stanford in 1985,\neconomics, not computer science, was the most popular major. To most people on campus, the tech\nsector seemed idiosyncratic or even provincial.\nThe internet changed all this. The Mosaic browser was officially released in November 1993,\ngiving regular people a way to get online. Mosaic became Netscape, which released its Navigator\nbrowser in late 1994. Navigator\u2019s adoption grew so quickly\u2014from about 20% of the browser market\nin January 1995 to almost 80% less than 12 months later\u2014that Netscape was able to IPO in August\n\u201995 even though it wasn\u2019t yet profitable. Within five months, Netscape stock had shot up from $28 to\n$174 per share. Other tech companies were booming, too. Yahoo! went public in April \u201996 with an\n$848 million valuation. Amazon followed suit in May \u201997 at $438 million. By spring of \u201998, each\ncompany\u2019s stock had more than quadrupled. Skeptics questioned earnings and revenue multiples\nhigher than those for any non-internet company. It was easy to conclude that the market had gone\ncrazy.\nThis conclusion was understandable but misplaced. In December \u201996\u2014more than three years\nbefore the bubble actually burst\u2014Fed chairman Alan Greenspan warned that \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d\nmight have \u201cunduly escalated asset values.\u201d Tech investors were exuberant, but it\u2019s not clear that they\nwere so irrational. It is too easy to forget that things weren\u2019t going very well in the rest of the world\nat the time.\nThe East Asian financial crises hit in July 1997. Crony capitalism and massive foreign debt\nbrought the Thai, Indonesian, and South Korean economies to their knees. The ruble crisis followed\nin August \u201998 when Russia, hamstrung by chronic fiscal deficits, devalued its currency and defaulted\non its debt. American investors grew nervous about a nation with 10,000 nukes and no money; the\nDow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 10% in a matter of days.\nPeople were right to worry. The ruble crisis set off a chain reaction that brought down Long-Term\nCapital Management, a highly leveraged U.S. hedge fund. LTCM managed to lose $4.6 billion in the\nlatter half of 1998, and still had over $100 billion in liabilities when the Fed intervened with a\nmassive bailout and slashed interest rates in order to prevent systemic disaster.

However, nobody had any use for\nthat product except the journalists who voted it one of the 10 worst business ideas of 1999.\nPalmPilots were still too exotic then, but email was already commonplace, so we decided to create a\nway to send and receive payments over email.\nBy the fall of \u201999, our email payment product worked well\u2014anyone could log in to our website\nand easily transfer money. But we didn\u2019t have enough customers, growth was slow, and expenses\nmounted. For PayPal to work, we needed to attract a critical mass of at least a million users.\nAdvertising was too ineffective to justify the cost. Prospective deals with big banks kept falling\nthrough. So we decided to pay people to sign up.\nWe gave new customers $10 for joining, and we gave them $10 more every time they referred a\nfriend. This got us hundreds of thousands of new customers and an exponential growth rate. Of\ncourse, this customer acquisition strategy was unsustainable on its own\u2014when you pay people to be\nyour customers, exponential growth means an exponentially growing cost structure.

A South Korean firm wired us $5 million without first\nnegotiating a deal or signing any documents. When I tried to return the money, they wouldn\u2019t tell me\nwhere to send it.)

Focus on product, not sales\nIf your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it\u2019s not good enough: technology is\nprimarily about product development, not distribution. Bubble-era advertising was obviously\nwasteful, so the only sustainable growth is viral growth.\nThese lessons have become dogma in the startup world; those who would ignore them are\npresumed to invite the justified doom visited upon technology in the great crash of 2000. And yet the\nopposite principles are probably more correct:\n1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality.\n2. A bad plan is better than no plan.\n3. Competitive markets destroy profits.\n4. Sales matters just as much as product.\nIt\u2019s true that there was a bubble in technology. The late \u201990s was a time of hubris: people believed\nin going from 0 to 1. Too few startups were actually getting there, and many never went beyond\ntalking about it. But people understood that we had no choice but to find ways to do more with less.\nThe market high of March 2000 was obviously a peak of insanity; less obvious but more important, it\nwas also a peak of clarity. People looked far into the future, saw how much valuable new technology\nwe would need to get there safely, and judged themselves capable of creating it.\nWe still need new technology, and we may even need some 1999-style hubris and exuberance to\nget it. To build the next generation of companies, we must abandon the dogmas created after the crash.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the opposite ideas are automatically true: you can\u2019t escape the madness of crowds\nby dogmatically rejecting them. Instead ask yourself: how much of what you know about business is\nshaped by mistaken reactions to past mistakes? The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the\ncrowd but to think for yourself.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2627, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbe45b34-1e34-40e9-be12-3fb5f9c73cab": {"__data__": {"id_": "bbe45b34-1e34-40e9-be12-3fb5f9c73cab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 160, "file_path": "src/data/zero-to-one.pdf", "source": "21", "chapter": "Lessons Learned", "chapter_title": "Lessons Learned", "page_number": "21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fdf12604-525e-429c-a33c-b2c3b2948469", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"total_pages": 160, "file_path": "src/data/zero-to-one.pdf", "source": "21", "chapter": "Lessons Learned", "chapter_title": "Lessons Learned", "page_number": "21"}, "hash": "e476bb831e8453ad2feab018217a17ce60fcf88bc4548f2c3ff0ba718e70935c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "3", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4, "end_char_idx": 5, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9da0b553-aa22-4e30-beb6-994400cb99d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "9da0b553-aa22-4e30-beb6-994400cb99d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 160, "file_path": "src/data/zero-to-one.pdf", "source": "22", "chapter": "Chapter 3: All Happy Companies Are Different", "chapter_number": "3", "chapter_title": "All Happy Companies Are Different", "page_number": "22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4d505ea6-8a83-4614-887a-956d2a6ea98b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"total_pages": 160, "file_path": "src/data/zero-to-one.pdf", "source": "22", "chapter": "Chapter 3: All Happy Companies Are Different", "chapter_number": "3", "chapter_title": "All Happy Companies Are Different", "page_number": "22"}, "hash": "a1502e00f804a17b20200fdda4013946c9cc1908f666b1ce755b09ef76816357", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "ALL HAPPY COMPANIES ARE DIFFERENT\nTHE BUSINESS VERSION of our contrarian question is: what valuable company is nobody building? This\nquestion is harder than it looks, because your company could create a lot of value without becoming\nvery valuable itself. Creating value is not enough\u2014you also need to capture some of the value you\ncreate.\nThis means that even very big businesses can be bad businesses. For example, U.S. airline\ncompanies serve millions of passengers and create hundreds of billions of dollars of value each year.\nBut in 2012, when the average airfare each way was $178, the airlines made only 37 cents per\npassenger trip. Compare them to Google, which creates less value but captures far more. Google\nbrought in $50 billion in 2012 (versus $160 billion for the airlines), but it kept 21% of those revenues\nas profits\u2014more than 100 times the airline industry\u2019s profit margin that year. Google makes so much\nmoney that it\u2019s now worth three times more than every U.S. airline combined.\nThe airlines compete with each other, but Google stands alone. Economists use two simplified\nmodels to explain the difference: perfect competition and monopoly.\n\u201cPerfect competition\u201d is considered both the ideal and the default state in Economics 101. So-\ncalled perfectly competitive markets achieve equilibrium when producer supply meets consumer\ndemand. Every firm in a competitive market is undifferentiated and sells the same homogeneous\nproducts. Since no firm has any market power, they must all sell at whatever price the market\ndetermines. If there is money to be made, new firms will enter the market, increase supply, drive\nprices down, and thereby eliminate the profits that attracted them in the first place. If too many firms\nenter the market, they\u2019ll suffer losses, some will fold, and prices will rise back to sustainable levels.\nUnder perfect competition, in the long run no company makes an economic profit.\nThe opposite of perfect competition is monopoly. Whereas a competitive firm must sell at the\nmarket price, a monopoly owns its market, so it can set its own prices. Since it has no competition, it\nproduces at the quantity and price combination that maximizes its profits.\nTo an economist, every monopoly looks the same, whether it deviously eliminates rivals, secures a\nlicense from the state, or innovates its way to the top. In this book, we\u2019re not interested in illegal\nbullies or government favorites: by \u201cmonopoly,\u201d we mean the kind of company that\u2019s so good at what\nit does that no other firm can offer a close substitute. Google is a good example of a company that\nwent from 0 to 1: it hasn\u2019t competed in search since the early 2000s, when it definitively distanced\nitself from Microsoft and Yahoo!\nAmericans mythologize competition and credit it with saving us from socialist bread lines.\nActually, capitalism and competition are opposites. Capitalism is premised on the accumulation of\ncapital, but under perfect competition all profits get competed away.

There\u2019s an enormous difference between perfect\ncompetition and monopoly, and most businesses are much closer to one extreme than we commonly\nrealize.\nThe confusion comes from a universal bias for describing market conditions in self-serving ways:\nboth monopolists and competitors are incentivized to bend the truth.\nMonopoly Lies\nMonopolists lie to protect themselves. They know that bragging about their great monopoly invites\nbeing audited, scrutinized, and attacked. Since they very much want their monopoly profits to continue\nunmolested, they tend to do whatever they can to conceal their monopoly\u2014usually by exaggerating the\npower of their (nonexistent) competition.\nThink about how Google talks about its business. It certainly doesn\u2019t claim to be a monopoly. But\nis it one? Well, it depends: a monopoly in what? Let\u2019s say that Google is primarily a search engine.\nAs of May 2014, it owns about 68% of the search market. (Its closest competitors, Microsoft and\nYahoo!, have about 19% and 10%, respectively.) If that doesn\u2019t seem dominant enough, consider the\nfact that the word \u201cgoogle\u201d is now an official entry in the Oxford English Dictionary\u2014as a verb.\nDon\u2019t hold your breath waiting for that to happen to Bing.\nBut suppose we say that Google is primarily an advertising company. That changes things. The U.S.\nsearch engine advertising market is $17 billion annually. Online advertising is $37 billion annually.\nThe entire U.S. advertising market is $150 billion. And global advertising is a $495 billion market.\nSo even if Google completely monopolized U.S. search engine advertising, it would own just 3.4% of\nthe global advertising market.

Do\noutsized profits come at the expense of the rest of society? Actually, yes: profits come out of\ncustomers\u2019 wallets, and monopolies deserve their bad reputation\u2014but only in a world where\nnothing changes.\nIn a static world, a monopolist is just a rent collector. If you corner the market for something, you\ncan jack up the price; others will have no choice but to buy from you. Think of the famous board\ngame: deeds are shuffled around from player to player, but the board never changes. There\u2019s no way\nto win by inventing a better kind of real estate development. The relative values of the properties are\nfixed for all time, so all you can do is try to buy them up.\nBut the world we live in is dynamic: it\u2019s possible to invent new and better things. Creative\nmonopolists give customers more choices by adding entirely new categories of abundance to the\nworld. Creative monopolies aren\u2019t just good for the rest of society; they\u2019re powerful engines for\nmaking it better.\nEven the government knows this: that\u2019s why one of its departments works hard to create\nmonopolies (by granting patents to new inventions) even though another part hunts them down (by\nprosecuting antitrust cases). It\u2019s possible to question whether anyone should really be awarded a\nlegally enforceable monopoly simply for having been the first to think of something like a mobile\nsoftware design. But it\u2019s clear that something like Apple\u2019s monopoly profits from designing,\nproducing, and marketing the iPhone were the reward for creating greater abundance, not artificial\nscarcity: customers were happy to finally have the choice of paying high prices to get a smartphone\nthat actually works.\nThe dynamism of new monopolies itself explains why old monopolies don\u2019t strangle innovation.\nWith Apple\u2019s iOS at the forefront, the rise of mobile computing has dramatically reduced Microsoft\u2019s\ndecades-long operating system dominance. Before that, IBM\u2019s hardware monopoly of the \u201960s and\n\u201970s was overtaken by Microsoft\u2019s software monopoly. AT&T had a monopoly on telephone service\nfor most of the 20th century, but now anyone can get a cheap cell phone plan from any number of\nproviders. If the tendency of monopoly businesses were to hold back progress, they would be\ndangerous and we\u2019d be right to oppose them. But the history of progress is a history of better\nmonopoly businesses replacing incumbents.\nMonopolies drive progress because the promise of years or even decades of monopoly profits\nprovides a powerful incentive to innovate. Then monopolies can keep innovating because profits\nenable them to make the long-term plans and to finance the ambitious research projects that firms\nlocked in competition can\u2019t dream of.\nSo why are economists obsessed with competition as an ideal state? It\u2019s a relic of history.\nEconomists copied their mathematics from the work of 19th-century physicists: they see individuals\nand businesses as interchangeable atoms, not as unique creators.

The answer is that competition is not just an\neconomic concept or a simple inconvenience that individuals and companies must deal with in the\nmarketplace. More than anything else, competition is an ideology\u2014the ideology\u2014that pervades our\nsociety and distorts our thinking. We preach competition, internalize its necessity, and enact its\ncommandments; and as a result, we trap ourselves within it\u2014even though the more we compete, the\nless we gain.\nThis is a simple truth, but we\u2019ve all been trained to ignore it. Our educational system both drives\nand reflects our obsession with competition. Grades themselves allow precise measurement of each\nstudent\u2019s competitiveness; pupils with the highest marks receive status and credentials. We teach\nevery young person the same subjects in mostly the same ways, irrespective of individual talents and\npreferences. Students who don\u2019t learn best by sitting still at a desk are made to feel somehow\ninferior, while children who excel on conventional measures like tests and assignments end up\ndefining their identities in terms of this weirdly contrived academic parallel reality.\nAnd it gets worse as students ascend to higher levels of the tournament. Elite students climb\nconfidently until they reach a level of competition sufficiently intense to beat their dreams out of them.\nHigher education is the place where people who had big plans in high school get stuck in fierce\nrivalries with equally smart peers over conventional careers like management consulting and\ninvestment banking. For the privilege of being turned into conformists, students (or their families) pay\nhundreds of thousands of dollars in skyrocketing tuition that continues to outpace inflation. Why are\nwe doing this to ourselves?\nI wish I had asked myself when I was younger. My path was so tracked that in my 8th-grade\nyearbook, one of my friends predicted\u2014accurately\u2014that four years later I would enter Stanford as a\nsophomore. And after a conventionally successful undergraduate career, I enrolled at Stanford Law\nSchool, where I competed even harder for the standard badges of success.\nThe highest prize in a law student\u2019s world is unambiguous: out of tens of thousands of graduates\neach year, only a few dozen get a Supreme Court clerkship. After clerking on a federal appeals court\nfor a year, I was invited to interview for clerkships with Justices Kennedy and Scalia. My meetings\nwith the Justices went well. I was so close to winning this last competition. If only I got the clerkship,\nI thought, I would be set for life. But I didn\u2019t. At the time, I was devastated.\nIn 2004, after I had built and sold PayPal, I ran into an old friend from law school who had helped\nme prepare my failed clerkship applications. We hadn\u2019t spoken in nearly a decade. His first question\nwasn\u2019t \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d or \u201cCan you believe it\u2019s been so long?\u201d Instead, he grinned and asked:\n\u201cSo, Peter, aren\u2019t you glad you didn\u2019t get that clerkship?\u201d With the benefit of hindsight, we both knew\nthat winning that ultimate competition would have changed my life for the worse.

War metaphors invade our\neveryday business language: we use headhunters to build up a sales force that will enable us to take\na captive market and make a killing. But really it\u2019s competition, not business, that is like war:\nallegedly necessary, supposedly valiant, but ultimately destructive.\nWhy do people compete with each other? Marx and Shakespeare provide two models for\nunderstanding almost every kind of conflict.\nAccording to Marx, people fight because they are different. The proletariat fights the bourgeoisie\nbecause they have completely different ideas and goals (generated, for Marx, by their very different\nmaterial circumstances). The greater the differences, the greater the conflict.\nTo Shakespeare, by contrast, all combatants look more or less alike. It\u2019s not at all clear why they\nshould be fighting, since they have nothing to fight about. Consider the opening line from Romeo and\nJuliet: \u201cTwo households, both alike in dignity.\u201d The two houses are alike, yet they hate each other.\nThey grow even more similar as the feud escalates. Eventually, they lose sight of why they started\nfighting in the first place.\nIn the world of business, at least, Shakespeare proves the superior guide. Inside a firm, people\nbecome obsessed with their competitors for career advancement. Then the firms themselves become\nobsessed with their competitors in the marketplace. Amid all the human drama, people lose sight of\nwhat matters and focus on their rivals instead.\nLet\u2019s test the Shakespearean model in the real world. Imagine a production called Gates and\nSchmidt, based on Romeo and Juliet. Montague is Microsoft. Capulet is Google. Two great families,\nrun by alpha nerds, sure to clash on account of their sameness.\nAs with all good tragedy, the conflict seems inevitable only in retrospect. In fact it was entirely\navoidable. These families came from very different places. The House of Montague built operating\nsystems and office applications. The House of Capulet wrote a search engine. What was there to fight\nabout?\nLots, apparently. As a startup, each clan had been content to leave the other alone and prosper\nindependently. But as they grew, they began to focus on each other. Montagues obsessed about\nCapulets obsessed about Montagues. The result? Windows vs. Chrome OS, Bing vs. Google Search,\nExplorer vs. Chrome, Office vs. Docs, and Surface vs. Nexus.\nJust as war cost the Montagues and Capulets their children, it cost Microsoft and Google their\ndominance: Apple came along and overtook them all. In January 2013, Apple\u2019s market capitalization\nwas $500 billion, while Google and Microsoft combined were worth $467 billion. Just three years\nbefore, Microsoft and Google were each more valuable than Apple. War is costly business.\nRivalry causes us to overemphasize old opportunities and slavishly copy what has worked in the\npast. Consider the recent proliferation of mobile credit card readers. In October 2010, a startup\ncalled Square released a small, white, square-shaped product that let anyone with an iPhone swipe\nand accept credit cards. It was the first good payment processing solution for mobile handsets.\nImitators promptly sprang into action. A Canadian company called NetSecure launched its own card\nreader in a half-moon shape. Intuit brought a cylindrical reader to the geometric battle. In March\n2012, eBay\u2019s PayPal unit launched its own copycat card reader. It was shaped like a triangle\u2014a\nclear jab at Square, as three sides are simpler than four.

Then when you apply your skills, you\u2019re a\nlittle less likely than others to give up your own convictions: this can save you from getting caught up\nin crowds competing for obvious prizes.\nCompetition can make people hallucinate opportunities where none exist. The crazy \u201990s version\nof this was the fierce battle for the online pet store market. It was Pets.com vs. PetStore.com vs.\nPetopia.com vs. what seemed like dozens of others. Each company was obsessed with defeating its\nrivals, precisely because there were no substantive differences to focus on. Amid all the tactical\nquestions\u2014Who could price chewy dog toys most aggressively? Who could create the best Super\nBowl ads?\u2014these companies totally lost sight of the wider question of whether the online pet supply\nmarket was the right space to be in. Winning is better than losing, but everybody loses when the war\nisn\u2019t one worth fighting. When Pets.com folded after the dot-com crash, $300 million of investment\ncapital disappeared with it.\nOther times, rivalry is just weird and distracting. Consider the Shakespearean conflict between\nLarry Ellison, co-founder and CEO of Oracle, and Tom Siebel, a top salesman at Oracle and\nEllison\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 before he went on to found Siebel Systems in 1993. Ellison was livid at what he\nthought was Siebel\u2019s betrayal. Siebel hated being in the shadow of his former boss. The two men\nwere basically identical\u2014hard-charging Chicagoans who loved to sell and hated to lose\u2014so their\nhatred ran deep. Ellison and Siebel spent the second half of the \u201990s trying to sabotage each other. At\none point, Ellison sent truckloads of ice cream sandwiches to Siebel\u2019s headquarters to try to convince\nSiebel employees to jump ship. The copy on the wrappers? \u201cSummer is near. Oracle is here. To\nbrighten your day and your career.\u201d\nStrangely, Oracle intentionally accumulated enemies. Ellison\u2019s theory was that it\u2019s always good to\nhave an enemy, so long as it was large enough to appear threatening (and thus motivational to\nemployees) but not so large as to actually threaten the company. So Ellison was probably thrilled\nwhen in 1996 a small database company called Informix put up a billboard near Oracle\u2019s Redwood\nShores headquarters that read: CAUTION: DINOSAUR CROSSING.

By late 1999, we were in all-out war. Many of us at\nPayPal logged 100-hour workweeks. No doubt that was counterproductive, but the focus wasn\u2019t on\nobjective productivity; the focus was defeating X.com. One of our engineers actually designed a\nbomb for this purpose; when he presented the schematic at a team meeting, calmer heads prevailed\nand the proposal was attributed to extreme sleep deprivation.\nBut in February 2000, Elon and I were more scared about the rapidly inflating tech bubble than we\nwere about each other: a financial crash would ruin us both before we could finish our fight. So in\nearly March we met on neutral ground\u2014a caf\u00e9 almost exactly equidistant to our offices\u2014and\nnegotiated a 50-50 merger. De-escalating the rivalry post-merger wasn\u2019t easy, but as far as problems\ngo, it was a good one to have. As a unified team, we were able to ride out the dot-com crash and then\nbuild a successful business.\nSometimes you do have to fight. Where that\u2019s true, you should fight and win. There is no middle\nground: either don\u2019t throw any punches, or strike hard and end it quickly.\nThis advice can be hard to follow because pride and honor can get in the way. Hence Hamlet:\nExposing what is mortal and unsure\nTo all that fortune, death, and danger dare,\nEven for an eggshell. Rightly to be great\nIs not to stir without great argument,\nBut greatly to find quarrel in a straw\nWhen honor\u2019s at the stake.\nFor Hamlet, greatness means willingness to fight for reasons as thin as an eggshell: anyone would\nfight for things that matter; true heroes take their personal honor so seriously they will fight for things\nthat don\u2019t matter. This twisted logic is part of human nature, but it\u2019s disastrous in business.

But a great business is defined by its ability to generate cash flows in the future. Investors\nexpect Twitter will be able to capture monopoly profits over the next decade, while newspapers\u2019\nmonopoly days are over.\nSimply stated, the value of a business today is the sum of all the money it will make in the future.\n(To properly value a business, you also have to discount those future cash flows to their present\nworth, since a given amount of money today is worth more than the same amount in the future.)\nComparing discounted cash flows shows the difference between low-growth businesses and high-\ngrowth startups at its starkest. Most of the value of low-growth businesses is in the near term. An Old\nEconomy business (like a newspaper) might hold its value if it can maintain its current cash flows for\nfive or six years. However, any firm with close substitutes will see its profits competed away.\nNightclubs or restaurants are extreme examples: successful ones might collect healthy amounts today,\nbut their cash flows will probably dwindle over the next few years when customers move on to\nnewer and trendier alternatives.\nTechnology companies follow the opposite trajectory. They often lose money for the first few\nyears: it takes time to build valuable things, and that means delayed revenue. Most of a tech\ncompany\u2019s value will come at least 10 to 15 years in the future.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2027, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94b06d61-3c8a-4646-affe-322a08067f59": {"__data__": {"id_": "94b06d61-3c8a-4646-affe-322a08067f59", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 160, "file_path": "src/data/zero-to-one.pdf", "source": "38", "chapter": "Chapter 5: Last Mover Advantage", "chapter_number": "5", "chapter_title": "Last Mover Advantage", "page_number": "38"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "82a3eaf0-57a6-4f6e-9cf2-fe506e50d665", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"total_pages": 160, "file_path": "src/data/zero-to-one.pdf", "source": "38", "chapter": "Chapter 5: Last Mover Advantage", "chapter_number": "5", "chapter_title": "Last Mover Advantage", "page_number": "38"}, "hash": "62a8e82f7ffe9b6dedc3708c9dbd431b11913e52200c132bedde131bde4c8e37", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In March 2001, PayPal had yet to make a profit but our revenues were growing 100% year-over-\nyear.

Every monopoly is unique,\nbut they usually share some combination of the following characteristics: proprietary technology,\nnetwork effects, economies of scale, and branding.\nThis isn\u2019t a list of boxes to check as you build your business\u2014there\u2019s no shortcut to monopoly.\nHowever, analyzing your business according to these characteristics can help you think about how to\nmake it durable.\n1. Proprietary Technology\nProprietary technology is the most substantive advantage a company can have because it makes your\nproduct difficult or impossible to replicate. Google\u2019s search algorithms, for example, return results\nbetter than anyone else\u2019s. Proprietary technologies for extremely short page load times and highly\naccurate query autocompletion add to the core search product\u2019s robustness and defensibility. It would\nbe very hard for anyone to do to Google what Google did to all the other search engine companies in\nthe early 2000s.\nAs a good rule of thumb, proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest\nsubstitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage. Anything less than an\norder of magnitude better will probably be perceived as a marginal improvement and will be hard to\nsell, especially in an already crowded market.\nThe clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something completely new. If you build\nsomething valuable where there was nothing before, the increase in value is theoretically infinite. A\ndrug to safely eliminate the need for sleep, or a cure for baldness, for example, would certainly\nsupport a monopoly business.\nOr you can radically improve an existing solution: once you\u2019re 10x better, you escape competition.\nPayPal, for instance, made buying and selling on eBay at least 10 times better. Instead of mailing a\ncheck that would take 7 to 10 days to arrive, PayPal let buyers pay as soon as an auction ended.\nSellers received their proceeds right away, and unlike with a check, they knew the funds were good.\nAmazon made its first 10x improvement in a particularly visible way: they offered at least 10 times\nas many books as any other bookstore. When it launched in 1995, Amazon could claim to be \u201cEarth\u2019s\nlargest bookstore\u201d because, unlike a retail bookstore that might stock 100,000 books, Amazon didn\u2019t\nneed to physically store any inventory\u2014it simply requested the title from its supplier whenever a\ncustomer made an order. This quantum improvement was so effective that a very unhappy Barnes &\nNoble filed a lawsuit three days before Amazon\u2019s IPO, claiming that Amazon was unfairly calling\nitself a \u201cbookstore\u201d when really it was a \u201cbook broker.\u201d\nYou can also make a 10x improvement through superior integrated design. Before 2010, tablet\ncomputing was so poor that for all practical purposes the market didn\u2019t even exist. \u201cMicrosoft\nWindows XP Tablet PC Edition\u201d products first shipped in 2002, and Nokia released its own\n\u201cInternet Tablet\u201d in 2005, but they were a pain to use. Then Apple released the iPad. Design\nimprovements are hard to measure, but it seems clear that Apple improved on anything that had come\nbefore by at least an order of magnitude: tablets went from unusable to useful.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3292, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d845855-b0fd-4fb2-b1ef-4007198a96fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "6d845855-b0fd-4fb2-b1ef-4007198a96fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 160, "file_path": "src/data/zero-to-one.pdf", "source": "41", "chapter": "Characteristics Of Monopoly", "chapter_title": "Characteristics Of Monopoly", "page_number": "41"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1fba20f1-4991-453f-9f5e-1c352e3cd9c3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"total_pages": 160, "file_path": "src/data/zero-to-one.pdf", "source": "41", "chapter": "Characteristics Of Monopoly", "chapter_title": "Characteristics Of Monopoly", "page_number": "41"}, "hash": "6f2ca640468bc58b4a397986d772891234d175f506f6b683634b3ef8d3660931", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "2. Network Effects\nNetwork effects make a product more useful as more people use it. For example, if all your friends\nare on Facebook, it makes sense for you to join Facebook, too. Unilaterally choosing a different\nsocial network would only make you an eccentric.\nNetwork effects can be powerful, but you\u2019ll never reap them unless your product is valuable to its\nvery first users when the network is necessarily small. For example, in 1960 a quixotic company\ncalled Xanadu set out to build a two-way communication network between all computers\u2014a sort of\nearly, synchronous version of the World Wide Web. After more than three decades of futile effort,\nXanadu folded just as the web was becoming commonplace. Their technology probably would have\nworked at scale, but it could have worked only at scale: it required every computer to join the\nnetwork at the same time, and that was never going to happen.\nParadoxically, then, network effects businesses must start with especially small markets. Facebook\nstarted with just Harvard students\u2014Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s first product was designed to get all his\nclassmates signed up, not to attract all people of Earth. This is why successful network businesses\nrarely get started by MBA types: the initial markets are so small that they often don\u2019t even appear to\nbe business opportunities at all.\n3. Economies of Scale\nA monopoly business gets stronger as it gets bigger: the fixed costs of creating a product (engineering,\nmanagement, office space) can be spread out over ever greater quantities of sales. Software startups\ncan enjoy especially dramatic economies of scale because the marginal cost of producing another\ncopy of the product is close to zero.\nMany businesses gain only limited advantages as they grow to large scale. Service businesses\nespecially are difficult to make monopolies. If you own a yoga studio, for example, you\u2019ll only be\nable to serve a certain number of customers. You can hire more instructors and expand to more\nlocations, but your margins will remain fairly low and you\u2019ll never reach a point where a core group\nof talented people can provide something of value to millions of separate clients, as software\nengineers are able to do.\nA good startup should have the potential for great scale built into its first design. Twitter already\nhas more than 250 million users today. It doesn\u2019t need to add too many customized features in order to\nacquire more, and there\u2019s no inherent reason why it should ever stop growing.\n4. Branding\nA company has a monopoly on its own brand by definition, so creating a strong brand is a powerful\nway to claim a monopoly. Today\u2019s strongest tech brand is Apple: the attractive looks and carefully\nchosen materials of products like the iPhone and MacBook, the Apple Stores\u2019 sleek minimalist design\nand close control over the consumer experience, the omnipresent advertising campaigns, the price\npositioning as a maker of premium goods, and the lingering nimbus of Steve Jobs\u2019s personal charisma\nall contribute to a perception that Apple offers products so good as to constitute a category of their\nown.\nMany have tried to learn from Apple\u2019s success: paid advertising, branded stores, luxurious", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3191, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78cefc5f-6ff3-49de-abfc-2eaad7d647f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "78cefc5f-6ff3-49de-abfc-2eaad7d647f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 160, "file_path": "src/data/zero-to-one.pdf", "source": "42", "chapter": "Characteristics Of Monopoly", "chapter_title": "Characteristics Of Monopoly", "page_number": "42"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cdd4ad8f-2554-4d08-bff1-04c327f257ba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"total_pages": 160, "file_path": "src/data/zero-to-one.pdf", "source": "42", "chapter": "Characteristics Of Monopoly", "chapter_title": "Characteristics Of Monopoly", "page_number": "42"}, "hash": "fb7ae41c39afcc7800c41b8184d4bd9e4ae3ad5cf8879fdb5e1ea2e87268c64a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "materials, playful keynote speeches, high prices, and even minimalist design are all susceptible to\nimitation. But these techniques for polishing the surface don\u2019t work without a strong underlying\nsubstance. Apple has a complex suite of proprietary technologies, both in hardware (like superior\ntouchscreen materials) and software (like touchscreen interfaces purpose-designed for specific\nmaterials). It manufactures products at a scale large enough to dominate pricing for the materials it\nbuys. And it enjoys strong network effects from its content ecosystem: thousands of developers write\nsoftware for Apple devices because that\u2019s where hundreds of millions of users are, and those users\nstay on the platform because it\u2019s where the apps are. These other monopolistic advantages are less\nobvious than Apple\u2019s sparkling brand, but they are the fundamentals that let the branding effectively\nreinforce Apple\u2019s monopoly.\nBeginning with brand rather than substance is dangerous.

But the big\nquestion is what products Yahoo! will actually create. When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, he didn\u2019t\njust make Apple a cool place to work; he slashed product lines to focus on the handful of\nopportunities for 10x improvements.

Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. Therefore,\nevery startup should start with a very small market. Always err on the side of starting too small.\nThe reason is simple: it\u2019s easier to dominate a small market than a large one. If you think your initial\nmarket might be too big, it almost certainly is.\nSmall doesn\u2019t mean nonexistent. We made this mistake early on at PayPal. Our first product let\npeople beam money to each other via PalmPilots. It was interesting technology and no one else was\ndoing it. However, the world\u2019s millions of PalmPilot users weren\u2019t concentrated in a particular\nplace, they had little in common, and they used their devices only episodically. Nobody needed our\nproduct, so we had no customers.\nWith that lesson learned, we set our sights on eBay auctions, where we found our first success. In\nlate 1999, eBay had a few thousand high-volume \u201cPowerSellers,\u201d and after only three months of\ndedicated effort, we were serving 25% of them. It was much easier to reach a few thousand people\nwho really needed our product than to try to compete for the attention of millions of scattered\nindividuals.\nThe perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together\nand served by few or no competitors. Any big market is a bad choice, and a big market already\nserved by competing companies is even worse. This is why it\u2019s always a red flag when entrepreneurs\ntalk about getting 1% of a $100 billion market. In practice, a large market will either lack a good\nstarting point or it will be open to competition, so it\u2019s hard to ever reach that 1%. And even if you do\nsucceed in gaining a small foothold, you\u2019ll have to be satisfied with keeping the lights on: cutthroat\ncompetition means your profits will be zero.\nScaling Up\nOnce you create and dominate a niche market, then you should gradually expand into related and\nslightly broader markets. Amazon shows how it can be done. Jeff Bezos\u2019s founding vision was to\ndominate all of online retail, but he very deliberately started with books. There were millions of\nbooks to catalog, but they all had roughly the same shape, they were easy to ship, and some of the\nmost rarely sold books\u2014those least profitable for any retail store to keep in stock\u2014also drew the\nmost enthusiastic customers. Amazon became the dominant solution for anyone located far from a\nbookstore or seeking something unusual. Amazon then had two options: expand the number of people\nwho read books, or expand to adjacent markets. They chose the latter, starting with the most similar\nmarkets: CDs, videos, and software. Amazon continued to add categories gradually until it had\nbecome the world\u2019s general store. The name itself brilliantly encapsulated the company\u2019s scaling\nstrategy. The biodiversity of the Amazon rain forest reflected Amazon\u2019s first goal of cataloging every\nbook in the world, and now it stands for every kind of thing in the world, period.\neBay also started by dominating small niche markets.

Once it monopolized the Beanie Baby trade, eBay didn\u2019t jump\nstraight to listing sports cars or industrial surplus: it continued to cater to small-time hobbyists until it\nbecame the most reliable marketplace for people trading online no matter what the item.\nSometimes there are hidden obstacles to scaling\u2014a lesson that eBay has learned in recent years.\nLike all marketplaces, the auction marketplace lent itself to natural monopoly because buyers go\nwhere the sellers are and vice versa. But eBay found that the auction model works best for\nindividually distinctive products like coins and stamps. It works less well for commodity products:\npeople don\u2019t want to bid on pencils or Kleenex, so it\u2019s more convenient just to buy them from\nAmazon. eBay is still a valuable monopoly; it\u2019s just smaller than people in 2004 expected it to be.\nSequencing markets correctly is underrated, and it takes discipline to expand gradually.

This is roughly what happened when the advent of PCs disrupted\nthe market for mainframe computers: at first PCs seemed irrelevant, then they became dominant.\nToday mobile devices may be doing the same thing to PCs.\nHowever, disruption has recently transmogrified into a self-congratulatory buzzword for anything\nposing as trendy and new. This seemingly trivial fad matters because it distorts an entrepreneur\u2019s\nself-understanding in an inherently competitive way. The concept was coined to describe threats to\nincumbent companies, so startups\u2019 obsession with disruption means they see themselves through older\nfirms\u2019 eyes. If you think of yourself as an insurgent battling dark forces, it\u2019s easy to become unduly\nfixated on the obstacles in your path. But if you truly want to make something new, the act of creation\nis far more important than the old industries that might not like what you create. Indeed, if your\ncompany can be summed up by its opposition to already existing firms, it can\u2019t be completely new\nand it\u2019s probably not going to become a monopoly.\nDisruption also attracts attention: disruptors are people who look for trouble and find it. Disruptive\nkids get sent to the principal\u2019s office. Disruptive companies often pick fights they can\u2019t win. Think of\nNapster: the name itself meant trouble. What kinds of things can one \u201cnap\u201d? Music \u2026 Kids \u2026 and\nperhaps not much else.

Malcolm Gladwell, a successful author who writes about\nsuccessful people, declares in Outliers that success results from a \u201cpatchwork of lucky breaks and\narbitrary advantages.\u201d Warren Buffett famously considers himself a \u201cmember of the lucky sperm\nclub\u201d and a winner of the \u201covarian lottery.\u201d Jeff Bezos attributes Amazon\u2019s success to an \u201cincredible\nplanetary alignment\u201d and jokes that it was \u201chalf luck, half good timing, and the rest brains.\u201d Bill Gates\neven goes so far as to claim that he \u201cwas lucky to be born with certain skills,\u201d though it\u2019s not clear\nwhether that\u2019s actually possible.\nPerhaps these guys are being strategically humble. However, the phenomenon of serial\nentrepreneurship would seem to call into question our tendency to explain success as the product of\nchance. Hundreds of people have started multiple multimillion-dollar businesses. A few, like Steve\nJobs, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk, have created several multibillion-dollar companies. If success\nwere mostly a matter of luck, these kinds of serial entrepreneurs probably wouldn\u2019t exist.\nIn January 2013, Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter and Square, tweeted to his 2 million followers:\n\u201cSuccess is never accidental.\u201d\nMost of the replies were unambiguously negative. Referencing the tweet in The Atlantic, reporter\nAlexis Madrigal wrote that his instinct was to reply: \u201c \u2018Success is never accidental,\u2019 said all\nmultimillionaire white men.\u201d It\u2019s true that already successful people have an easier time doing new\nthings, whether due to their networks, wealth, or experience. But perhaps we\u2019ve become too quick to\ndismiss anyone who claims to have succeeded according to plan.\nIs there a way to settle this debate objectively? Unfortunately not, because companies are not\nexperiments. To get a scientific answer about Facebook, for example, we\u2019d have to rewind to 2004,\ncreate 1,000 copies of the world, and start Facebook in each copy to see how many times it would\nsucceed. But that experiment is impossible. Every company starts in unique circumstances, and every\ncompany starts only once. Statistics doesn\u2019t work when the sample size is one.\nFrom the Renaissance and the Enlightenment to the mid-20th century, luck was something to be\nmastered, dominated, and controlled; everyone agreed that you should do what you could, not focus\non what you couldn\u2019t. Ralph Waldo Emerson captured this ethos when he wrote: \u201cShallow men\nbelieve in luck, believe in circumstances.\u2026 Strong men believe in cause and effect.\u201d In 1912, after he\nbecame the first explorer to reach the South Pole, Roald Amundsen wrote: \u201cVictory awaits him who\nhas everything in order\u2014luck, people call it.\u201d No one pretended that misfortune didn\u2019t exist, but prior\ngenerations believed in making their own luck by working hard.\nIf you believe your life is mainly a matter of chance, why read this book? Learning about startups is\nworthless if you\u2019re just reading stories about people who won the lottery. Slot Machines for\nDummies can purport to tell you which kind of rabbit\u2019s foot to rub or how to tell which machines are\n\u201chot,\u201d but it can\u2019t tell you how to win.\nDid Bill Gates simply win the intelligence lottery? Was Sheryl Sandberg born with a silver spoon,\nor did she \u201clean in\u201d? When we debate historical questions like these, luck is in the past tense.

Even today pessimism still dominates huge parts of the world. An indefinite\npessimist looks out onto a bleak future, but he has no idea what to do about it.

The European Central Bank\ndoesn\u2019t stand for anything but improvisation: the U.S. Treasury prints \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d on the\ndollar; the ECB might as well print \u201cKick the Can Down the Road\u201d on the euro.

Perhaps surprisingly, China is probably the most definitely pessimistic place in the world today.\nWhen Americans see the Chinese economy grow ferociously fast (10% per year since 2000), we\nimagine a confident country mastering its future. But that\u2019s because Americans are still optimists, and\nwe project our optimism onto China. From China\u2019s viewpoint, economic growth cannot come fast\nenough. Every other country is afraid that China is going to take over the world; China is the only\ncountry afraid that it won\u2019t.\nChina can grow so fast only because its starting base is so low. The easiest way for China to grow\nis to relentlessly copy what has already worked in the West. And that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s doing:\nexecuting definite plans by burning ever more coal to build ever more factories and skyscrapers. But\nwith a huge population pushing resource prices higher, there\u2019s no way Chinese living standards can\never actually catch up to those of the richest countries, and the Chinese know it.\nThis is why the Chinese leadership is obsessed with the way in which things threaten to get worse.\nEvery senior Chinese leader experienced famine as a child, so when the Politburo looks to the future,\ndisaster is not an abstraction. The Chinese public, too, knows that winter is coming. Outsiders are\nfascinated by the great fortunes being made inside China, but they pay less attention to the wealthy\nChinese trying hard to get their money out of the country. Poorer Chinese just save everything they can\nand hope it will be enough.

Undaunted by his lack of credentials, he publicly proposed to build two huge dams in the\nBay, construct massive freshwater lakes for drinking water and irrigation, and reclaim 20,000 acres\nof land for development. Even though he had no personal authority, people took the Reber Plan\nseriously. It was endorsed by newspaper editorial boards across California. The U.S. Congress held\nhearings on its feasibility. The Army Corps of Engineers even constructed a 1.5-acre scale model of\nthe Bay in a cavernous Sausalito warehouse to simulate it. These tests revealed technical\nshortcomings, so the plan wasn\u2019t executed.\nBut would anybody today take such a vision seriously in the first place? In the 1950s, people\nwelcomed big plans and asked whether they would work.

Technological advance seemed to\naccelerate automatically, so the Boomers grew up with great expectations but few specific plans for\nhow to fulfill them. Then, when technological progress stalled in the 1970s, increasing income\ninequality came to the rescue of the most elite Boomers. Every year of adulthood continued to get\nautomatically better and better for the rich and successful. The rest of their generation was left\nbehind, but the wealthy Boomers who shape public opinion today see little reason to question their\nna\u00efve optimism. Since tracked careers worked for them, they can\u2019t imagine that they won\u2019t work for\ntheir kids, too.\nMalcolm Gladwell says you can\u2019t understand Bill Gates\u2019s success without understanding his\nfortunate personal context: he grew up in a good family, went to a private school equipped with a\ncomputer lab, and counted Paul Allen as a childhood friend. But perhaps you can\u2019t understand\nMalcolm Gladwell without understanding his historical context as a Boomer (born in 1963).

If they don\u2019t go to law school, bright college graduates head to Wall Street precisely because\nthey have no real plan for their careers.

Think about what happens when successful\nentrepreneurs sell their company. What do they do with the money? In a financialized world, it\nunfolds like this:\n\u2022 The founders don\u2019t know what to do with it, so they give it to a large bank.\n\u2022 The bankers don\u2019t know what to do with it, so they diversify by spreading it across a portfolio\nof institutional investors.\n\u2022 Institutional investors don\u2019t know what to do with their managed capital, so they diversify by\namassing a portfolio of stocks.\n\u2022 Companies try to increase their share price by generating free cash flows. If they do, they issue\ndividends or buy back shares and the cycle repeats.\nAt no point does anyone in the chain know what to do with money in the real economy. But in an\nindefinite world, people actually prefer unlimited optionality; money is more valuable than anything\nyou could possibly do with it. Only in a definite future is money a means to an end, not the end itself.\nIndefinite Politics\nPoliticians have always been officially accountable to the public at election time, but today they are\nattuned to what the public thinks at every moment. Modern polling enables politicians to tailor their\nimage to match preexisting public opinion exactly, so for the most part, they do. Nate Silver\u2019s\nelection predictions are remarkably accurate, but even more remarkable is how big a story they\nbecome every four years.

The only question was how best to cope with our tragic\nfate. Modern philosophers have been mostly optimistic. From Herbert Spencer on the right and Hegel\nin the center to Marx on the left, the 19th century shared a belief in progress. (Remember Marx and\nEngels\u2019s encomium to the technological triumphs of capitalism from this page.) These thinkers\nexpected material advances to fundamentally change human life for the better: they were definite\noptimists.\nIn the late 20th century, indefinite philosophies came to the fore. The two dominant political\nthinkers, John Rawls and Robert Nozick, are usually seen as stark opposites: on the egalitarian left,\nRawls was concerned with questions of fairness and distribution; on the libertarian right, Nozick\nfocused on maximizing individual freedom. They both believed that people could get along with each\nother peacefully, so unlike the ancients, they were optimistic. But unlike Spencer or Marx, Rawls and\nNozick were indefinite optimists: they didn\u2019t have any specific vision of the future.\nTheir indefiniteness took different forms. Rawls begins A Theory of Justice with the famous \u201cveil\nof ignorance\u201d: fair political reasoning is supposed to be impossible for anyone with knowledge of the\nworld as it concretely exists. Instead of trying to change our actual world of unique people and real\ntechnologies, Rawls fantasized about an \u201cinherently stable\u201d society with lots of fairness but little\ndynamism. Nozick opposed Rawls\u2019s \u201cpatterned\u201d concept of justice.

In\nphilosophy, politics, and business, too, arguing over process has become a way to endlessly defer\nmaking concrete plans for a better future.\nIndefinite Life\nOur ancestors sought to understand and extend the human lifespan. In the 16th century, conquistadors\nsearched the jungles of Florida for a Fountain of Youth. Francis Bacon wrote that \u201cthe prolongation of\nlife\u201d should be considered its own branch of medicine\u2014and the noblest. In the 1660s, Robert Boyle\nplaced life extension (along with \u201cthe Recovery of Youth\u201d) atop his famous wish list for the future of\nscience. Whether through geographic exploration or laboratory research, the best minds of the\nRenaissance thought of death as something to defeat. (Some resisters were killed in action: Bacon\ncaught pneumonia and died in 1626 while experimenting to see if he could extend a chicken\u2019s life by\nfreezing it in the snow.)\nWe haven\u2019t yet uncovered the secrets of life, but insurers and statisticians in the 19th century\nsuccessfully revealed a secret about death that still governs our thinking today: they discovered how\nto reduce it to a mathematical probability. \u201cLife tables\u201d tell us our chances of dying in any given year,\nsomething previous generations didn\u2019t know. However, in exchange for better insurance contracts, we\nseem to have given up the search for secrets about longevity. Systematic knowledge of the current\nrange of human lifespans has made that range seem natural. Today our society is permeated by the\ntwin ideas that death is both inevitable and random.\nMeanwhile, probabilistic attitudes have come to shape the agenda of biology itself. In 1928,\nScottish scientist Alexander Fleming found that a mysterious antibacterial fungus had grown on a petri\ndish he\u2019d forgotten to cover in his laboratory: he discovered penicillin by accident. Scientists have\nsought to harness the power of chance ever since. Modern drug discovery aims to amplify Fleming\u2019s\nserendipitous circumstances a millionfold: pharmaceutical companies search through combinations of\nmolecular compounds at random, hoping to find a hit.\nBut it\u2019s not working as well as it used to.

At the other extreme, a select few people like Einstein and Shakespeare\nare constantly quoted and ventriloquized.

They raise\nmoney from institutions and wealthy people, pool it into a fund, and invest in technology companies\nthat they believe will become more valuable. If they turn out to be right, they take a cut of the returns\n\u2014usually 20%. A venture fund makes money when the companies in its portfolio become more\nvaluable and either go public or get bought by larger companies. Venture funds usually have a 10-year\nlifespan since it takes time for successful companies to grow and \u201cexit.\u201d\nBut most venture-backed companies don\u2019t IPO or get acquired; most fail, usually soon after they\nstart. Due to these early failures, a venture fund typically loses money at first. VCs hope the value of\nthe fund will increase dramatically in a few years\u2019 time, to break-even and beyond, when the\nsuccessful portfolio companies hit their exponential growth spurts and start to scale.\nThe big question is when this takeoff will happen. For most funds, the answer is never. Most\nstartups fail, and most funds fail with them. Every VC knows that his task is to find the companies that\nwill succeed. However, even seasoned investors understand this phenomenon only superficially.\nThey know companies are different, but they underestimate the degree of difference.\nThe error lies in expecting that venture returns will be normally distributed: that is, bad companies\nwill fail, mediocre ones will stay flat, and good ones will return 2x or even 4x. Assuming this bland\npattern, investors assemble a diversified portfolio and hope that winners counterbalance losers.\nBut this \u201cspray and pray\u201d approach usually produces an entire portfolio of flops, with no hits at all.\nThis is because venture returns don\u2019t follow a normal distribution overall. Rather, they follow a\npower law: a small handful of companies radically outperform all others.

Palantir, the second-best investment, is set to\nreturn more than the sum of every other investment aside from Facebook. This highly uneven pattern is\nnot unusual: we see it in all our other funds as well. The biggest secret in venture capital is that the\nbest investment in a successful fund equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund combined.\nThis implies two very strange rules for VCs. First, only invest in companies that have the potential\nto return the value of the entire fund. This is a scary rule, because it eliminates the vast majority of\npossible investments. (Even quite successful companies usually succeed on a more humble scale.)\nThis leads to rule number two: because rule number one is so restrictive, there can\u2019t be any other\nrules.\nConsider what happens when you break the first rule. Andreessen Horowitz invested $250,000 in\nInstagram in 2010. When Facebook bought Instagram just two years later for $1 billion, Andreessen\nnetted $78 million\u2014a 312x return in less than two years. That\u2019s a phenomenal return, befitting the\nfirm\u2019s reputation as one of the Valley\u2019s best. But in a weird way it\u2019s not nearly enough, because\nAndreessen Horowitz has a $1.5 billion fund: if they only wrote $250,000 checks, they would need to\nfind 19 Instagrams just to break even. This is why investors typically put a lot more money into any\ncompany worth funding. (And to be fair, Andreessen would have invested more in Instagram\u2019s later\nrounds had it not been conflicted out by a previous investment.) VCs must find the handful of\ncompanies that will successfully go from 0 to 1 and then back them with every resource.\nOf course, no one can know with certainty ex ante which companies will succeed, so even the best\nVC firms have a \u201cportfolio.\u201d However, every single company in a good venture portfolio must have\nthe potential to succeed at vast scale. At Founders Fund, we focus on five to seven companies in a\nfund, each of which we think could become a multibillion-dollar business based on its unique\nfundamentals.

An entrepreneur makes a major investment just by spending her time\nworking on a startup. Therefore every entrepreneur must think about whether her company is going to\nsucceed and become valuable. Every individual is unavoidably an investor, too. When you choose a\ncareer, you act on your belief that the kind of work you do will be valuable decades from now.\nThe most common answer to the question of future value is a diversified portfolio: \u201cDon\u2019t put all\nyour eggs in one basket,\u201d everyone has been told. As we said, even the best venture investors have a\nportfolio, but investors who understand the power law make as few investments as possible. The kind\nof portfolio thinking embraced by both folk wisdom and financial convention, by contrast, regards\ndiversified betting as a source of strength. The more you dabble, the more you are supposed to have\nhedged against the uncertainty of the future.\nBut life is not a portfolio: not for a startup founder, and not for any individual. An entrepreneur\ncannot \u201cdiversify\u201d herself: you cannot run dozens of companies at the same time and then hope that\none of them works out well. Less obvious but just as important, an individual cannot diversify his\nown life by keeping dozens of equally possible careers in ready reserve.\nOur schools teach the opposite: institutionalized education traffics in a kind of homogenized,\ngeneric knowledge. Everybody who passes through the American school system learns not to think in\npower law terms. Every high school course period lasts 45 minutes whatever the subject. Every\nstudent proceeds at a similar pace. At college, model students obsessively hedge their futures by\nassembling a suite of exotic and minor skills. Every university believes in \u201cexcellence,\u201d and hundred-\npage course catalogs arranged alphabetically according to arbitrary departments of knowledge seem\ndesigned to reassure you that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what you do, as long as you do it well.\u201d That is\ncompletely false. It does matter what you do. You should focus relentlessly on something you\u2019re good\nat doing, but before that you must think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future.\nFor the startup world, this means you should not necessarily start your own company, even if you\nare extraordinarily talented. If anything, too many people are starting their own companies today.\nPeople who understand the power law will hesitate more than others when it comes to founding a\nnew venture: they know how tremendously successful they could become by joining the very best\ncompany while it\u2019s growing fast. The power law means that differences between companies will\ndwarf the differences in roles inside companies. You could have 100% of the equity if you fully fund\nyour own venture, but if it fails you\u2019ll have 100% of nothing. Owning just 0.01% of Google, by\ncontrast, is incredibly valuable (more than $35 million as of this writing).\nIf you do start your own company, you must remember the power law to operate it well. The most\nimportant things are singular: One market will probably be better than all others, as we discussed in\nChapter 5. One distribution strategy usually dominates all others, too\u2014for that see Chapter 11. Time\nand decision-making themselves follow a power law, and some moments matter far more than others\n\u2014see Chapter 9.

An extreme representative of this view is Ted\nKaczynski, infamously known as the Unabomber. Kaczynski was a child prodigy who enrolled at\nHarvard at 16. He went on to get a PhD in math and become a professor at UC Berkeley. But you\u2019ve\nonly ever heard of him because of the 17-year terror campaign he waged with pipe bombs against\nprofessors, technologists, and businesspeople.\nIn late 1995, the authorities didn\u2019t know who or where the Unabomber was. The biggest clue was a\n35,000-word manifesto that Kaczynski had written and anonymously mailed to the press. The FBI\nasked some prominent newspapers to publish it, hoping for a break in the case. It worked:\nKaczynski\u2019s brother recognized his writing style and turned him in.\nYou might expect that writing style to have shown obvious signs of insanity, but the manifesto is\neerily cogent. Kaczynski claimed that in order to be happy, every individual \u201cneeds to have goals\nwhose attainment requires effort, and needs to succeed in attaining at least some of his goals.\u201d He\ndivided human goals into three groups:\n1. Goals that can be satisfied with minimal effort;\n2. Goals that can be satisfied with serious effort; and\n3. Goals that cannot be satisfied, no matter how much effort one makes.\nThis is the classic trichotomy of the easy, the hard, and the impossible. Kaczynski argued that\nmodern people are depressed because all the world\u2019s hard problems have already been solved.\nWhat\u2019s left to do is either easy or impossible, and pursuing those tasks is deeply unsatisfying. What\nyou can do, even a child can do; what you can\u2019t do, even Einstein couldn\u2019t have done. So Kaczynski\u2019s\nidea was to destroy existing institutions, get rid of all technology, and let people start over and work\non hard problems anew.\nKaczynski\u2019s methods were crazy, but his loss of faith in the technological frontier is all around us.\nConsider the trivial but revealing hallmarks of urban hipsterdom: faux vintage photography, the\nhandlebar mustache, and vinyl record players all hark back to an earlier time when people were still\noptimistic about the future.

In between\u2014the zone\nof hard truths\u2014lies heresy. In the modern religion of environmentalism, the easy truth is that we must\nprotect the environment. Beyond that, Mother Nature knows best, and she cannot be questioned. Free\nmarketeers worship a similar logic. The value of things is set by the market. Even a child can look up\nstock quotes. But whether those prices make sense is not to be second-guessed; the market knows far\nmore than you ever could.\nWhy has so much of our society come to believe that there are no hard secrets left? It might start\nwith geography. There are no blank spaces left on the map anymore. If you grew up in the 18th\ncentury, there were still new places to go. After hearing tales of foreign adventure, you could become\nan explorer yourself. This was probably true up through the 19th and early 20th centuries; after that\npoint photography from National Geographic showed every Westerner what even the most exotic,\nunderexplored places on earth look like. Today, explorers are found mostly in history books and\nchildren\u2019s tales. Parents don\u2019t expect their kids to become explorers any more than they expect them\nto become pirates or sultans. Perhaps there are a few dozen uncontacted tribes somewhere deep in the\nAmazon, and we know there remains one last earthly frontier in the depths of the oceans. But the\nunknown seems less accessible than ever.\nAlong with the natural fact that physical frontiers have receded, four social trends have conspired\nto root out belief in secrets. First is incrementalism. From an early age, we are taught that the right\nway to do things is to proceed one very small step at a time, day by day, grade by grade. If you\noverachieve and end up learning something that\u2019s not on the test, you won\u2019t receive credit for it. But\nin exchange for doing exactly what\u2019s asked of you (and for doing it just a bit better than your peers),\nyou\u2019ll get an A. This process extends all the way up through the tenure track, which is why academics\nusually chase large numbers of trivial publications instead of new frontiers.\nSecond is risk aversion.

Social elites have the most freedom and ability to explore new thinking, but\nthey seem to believe in secrets the least. Why search for a new secret if you can comfortably collect\nrents on everything that has already been done? Every fall, the deans at top law schools and business\nschools welcome the incoming class with the same implicit message: \u201cYou got into this elite\ninstitution. Your worries are over.

Forty\nyears ago, people were more open to the idea that not all knowledge was widely known. From the\nCommunist Party to the Hare Krishnas, large numbers of people thought they could join some\nenlightened vanguard that would show them the Way. Very few people take unorthodox ideas\nseriously today, and the mainstream sees that as a sign of progress.

Every\ninjustice necessarily involves a moral truth that very few people recognize early on: in a democratic\nsociety, a wrongful practice persists only when most people don\u2019t perceive it to be unjust. At first,\nonly a small minority of abolitionists knew that slavery was evil; that view has rightly become\nconventional, but it was still a secret in the early 19th century. To say that there are no secrets left\ntoday would mean that we live in a society with no hidden injustices.\nIn economics, disbelief in secrets leads to faith in efficient markets. But the existence of financial\nbubbles shows that markets can have extraordinary inefficiencies. (And the more people believe in\nefficiency, the bigger the bubbles get.) In 1999, nobody wanted to believe that the internet was\nirrationally overvalued. The same was true of housing in 2005: Fed chairman Alan Greenspan had to\nacknowledge some \u201csigns of froth in local markets\u201d but stated that \u201ca bubble in home prices for the\nnation as a whole does not appear likely.\u201d The market reflected all knowable information and\ncouldn\u2019t be questioned. Then home prices fell across the country, and the financial crisis of 2008\nwiped out trillions. The future turned out to hold many secrets that economists could not make vanish\nsimply by ignoring them.\nWhat happens when a company stops believing in secrets? The sad decline of Hewlett-Packard\nprovides a cautionary tale. In 1990, the company was worth $9 billion. Then came a decade of\ninvention. In 1991, HP released the DeskJet 500C, the world\u2019s first affordable color printer. In 1993,\nit launched the OmniBook, one of the first \u201csuperportable\u201d laptops. The next year, HP released the\nOfficeJet, the world\u2019s first all-in-one printer/fax/copier. This relentless product expansion paid off:\nby mid-2000, HP was worth $135 billion.\nBut starting in late 1999, when HP introduced a new branding campaign around the imperative to\n\u201cinvent,\u201d it stopped inventing things. In 2001, the company launched HP Services, a glorified\nconsulting and support shop. In 2002, HP merged with Compaq, presumably because it didn\u2019t know\nwhat else to do. By 2005, the company\u2019s market cap had plunged to $70 billion\u2014roughly half of what\nit had been just five years earlier.\nHP\u2019s board was a microcosm of the dysfunction: it split into two factions, only one of which cared\nabout new technology. That faction was led by Tom Perkins, an engineer who first came to HP in\n1963 to run the company\u2019s research division at the personal request of Bill Hewlett and Dave\nPackard. At 73 years old in 2005, Perkins may as well have been a time-traveling visitor from a\nbygone age of optimism: he thought the board should identify the most promising new technologies\nand then have HP build them. But Perkins\u2019s faction lost out to its rival, led by chairwoman Patricia\nDunn. A banker by trade, Dunn argued that charting a plan for future technology was beyond the\nboard\u2019s competence. She thought the board should restrict itself to a night watchman\u2019s role: Was\neverything proper in the accounting department? Were people following all the rules?\nAmid this infighting, someone on the board started leaking information to the press. When it was\nexposed that Dunn arranged a series of illegal wiretaps to identify the source, the backlash was worse\nthan the original dissension, and the board was disgraced. Having abandoned the search for\ntechnological secrets, HP obsessed over gossip. As a result, by late 2012 HP was worth just $23\nbillion\u2014not much more than it was worth in 1990, adjusting for inflation.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3935, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "421b7c73-b304-45a1-890f-128d2d78d02d": {"__data__": {"id_": "421b7c73-b304-45a1-890f-128d2d78d02d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 160, "file_path": "src/data/zero-to-one.pdf", "source": "75", "chapter": "The Case For Secrets", "chapter_title": "The Case For Secrets", "page_number": "75"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "20d58775-e447-479e-b547-ddc1ae94d4c4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"total_pages": 160, "file_path": "src/data/zero-to-one.pdf", "source": "75", "chapter": "The Case For Secrets", "chapter_title": "The Case For Secrets", "page_number": "75"}, "hash": "bc9c882b03c65ed0712be50fd33bf60a534fd7eec306c1e7469aedf8934c474f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "THE CASE FOR SECRETS\nYou can\u2019t find secrets without looking for them. Andrew Wiles demonstrated this when he proved\nFermat\u2019s Last Theorem after 358 years of fruitless inquiry by other mathematicians\u2014the kind of\nsustained failure that might have suggested an inherently impossible task. Pierre de Fermat had\nconjectured in 1637 that no integers a, b, and c could satisfy the equation a\nn + b\nn = c\nn for any integer n\ngreater than 2. He claimed to have a proof, but he died without writing it down, so his conjecture long\nremained a major unsolved problem in mathematics. Wiles started working on it in 1986, but he kept\nit a secret until 1993, when he knew he was nearing a solution. After nine years of hard work, Wiles\nproved the conjecture in 1995. He needed brilliance to succeed, but he also needed a faith in secrets.\nIf you think something hard is impossible, you\u2019ll never even start trying to achieve it. Belief in secrets\nis an effective truth.\nThe actual truth is that there are many more secrets left to find, but they will yield only to relentless\nsearchers. There is more to do in science, medicine, engineering, and in technology of all kinds. We\nare within reach not just of marginal goals set at the competitive edge of today\u2019s conventional\ndisciplines, but of ambitions so great that even the boldest minds of the Scientific Revolution\nhesitated to announce them directly. We could cure cancer, dementia, and all the diseases of age and\nmetabolic decay. We can find new ways to generate energy that free the world from conflict over\nfossil fuels. We can invent faster ways to travel from place to place over the surface of the planet; we\ncan even learn how to escape it entirely and settle new frontiers. But we will never learn any of these\nsecrets unless we demand to know them and force ourselves to look.\nThe same is true of business. Great companies can be built on open but unsuspected secrets about\nhow the world works. Consider the Silicon Valley startups that have harnessed the spare capacity that\nis all around us but often ignored. Before Airbnb, travelers had little choice but to pay high prices for\na hotel room, and property owners couldn\u2019t easily and reliably rent out their unoccupied space.\nAirbnb saw untapped supply and unaddressed demand where others saw nothing at all. The same is\ntrue of private car services Lyft and Uber. Few people imagined that it was possible to build a\nbillion-dollar business by simply connecting people who want to go places with people willing to\ndrive them there.

Natural secrets exist all\naround us; to find them, one must study some undiscovered aspect of the physical world. Secrets\nabout people are different: they are things that people don\u2019t know about themselves or things they hide\nbecause they don\u2019t want others to know. So when thinking about what kind of company to build, there\nare two distinct questions to ask: What secrets is nature not telling you? What secrets are people not\ntelling you?\nIt\u2019s easy to assume that natural secrets are the most important: the people who look for them can\nsound intimidatingly authoritative. This is why physics PhDs are notoriously difficult to work with\u2014\nbecause they know the most fundamental truths, they think they know all truths. But does\nunderstanding electromagnetic theory automatically make you a great marriage counselor? Does a\ngravity theorist know more about your business than you do? At PayPal, I once interviewed a physics\nPhD for an engineering job. Halfway through my first question, he shouted, \u201cStop! I already know\nwhat you\u2019re going to ask!\u201d But he was wrong. It was the easiest no-hire decision I\u2019ve ever made.\nSecrets about people are relatively underappreciated. Maybe that\u2019s because you don\u2019t need a\ndozen years of higher education to ask the questions that uncover them: What are people not allowed\nto talk about? What is forbidden or taboo?\nSometimes looking for natural secrets and looking for human secrets lead to the same truth.\nConsider the monopoly secret again: competition and capitalism are opposites. If you didn\u2019t already\nknow it, you could discover it the natural, empirical way: do a quantitative study of corporate profits\nand you\u2019ll see they\u2019re eliminated by competition. But you could also take the human approach and\nask: what are people running companies not allowed to say? You would notice that monopolists\ndownplay their monopoly status to avoid scrutiny, while competitive firms strategically exaggerate\ntheir uniqueness. The differences between firms only seem small on the surface; in fact, they are\nenormous.\nThe best place to look for secrets is where no one else is looking. Most people think only in terms\nof what they\u2019ve been taught; schooling itself aims to impart conventional wisdom. So you might ask:\nare there any fields that matter but haven\u2019t been standardized and institutionalized? Physics, for\nexample, is a real major at all major universities, and it\u2019s set in its ways. The opposite of physics\nmight be astrology, but astrology doesn\u2019t matter. What about something like nutrition? Nutrition\nmatters for everybody, but you can\u2019t major in it at Harvard. Most top scientists go into other fields.\nMost of the big studies were done 30 or 40 years ago, and most are seriously flawed. The food\npyramid that told us to eat low fat and enormous amounts of grains was probably more a product of\nlobbying by Big Food than real science; its chief impact has been to aggravate our obesity epidemic.\nThere\u2019s plenty more to learn: we know more about the physics of faraway stars than we know about\nhuman nutrition. It won\u2019t be easy, but it\u2019s not obviously impossible: exactly the kind of field that\ncould yield secrets.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3255, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75206bcf-9e1b-4ee1-abbb-af6e0d0cfb55": {"__data__": {"id_": "75206bcf-9e1b-4ee1-abbb-af6e0d0cfb55", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 160, "file_path": "src/data/zero-to-one.pdf", "source": "77", "chapter": "What To Do With Secrets", "chapter_title": "What To Do With Secrets", "page_number": "77"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f487b60f-808c-484e-b8ec-fe6a41ce184b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"total_pages": 160, "file_path": "src/data/zero-to-one.pdf", "source": "77", "chapter": "What To Do With Secrets", "chapter_title": "What To Do With Secrets", "page_number": "77"}, "hash": "06d88b722bc679a915a702ce78c069c02899a8916b52135edbbf0a8339d92b84", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "WHAT TO DO WITH SECRETS\nIf you find a secret, you face a choice: Do you tell anyone? Or do you keep it to yourself?\nIt depends on the secret: some are more dangerous than others. As Faust tells Wagner:\nThe few who knew what might be learned,\nFoolish enough to put their whole heart on show,\nAnd reveal their feelings to the crowd below,\nMankind has always crucified and burned.\nUnless you have perfectly conventional beliefs, it\u2019s rarely a good idea to tell everybody everything\nthat you know.\nSo who do you tell? Whoever you need to, and no more. In practice, there\u2019s always a golden mean\nbetween telling nobody and telling everybody\u2014and that\u2019s a company. The best entrepreneurs know\nthis: every great business is built around a secret that\u2019s hidden from the outside.

Everyone in your company needs to work well together.\nA Silicon Valley libertarian might say you could solve this problem by restricting yourself to a sole\nproprietorship. Freud, Jung, and every other psychologist has a theory about how every individual\nmind is divided against itself, but in business at least, working for yourself guarantees alignment.\nUnfortunately, it also limits what kind of company you can build. It\u2019s very hard to go from 0 to 1\nwithout a team.\nA Silicon Valley anarchist might say you could achieve perfect alignment as long as you hire just\nthe right people, who will flourish peacefully without any guiding structure. Serendipity and even\nfree-form chaos at the workplace are supposed to help \u201cdisrupt\u201d all the old rules made and obeyed by\nthe rest of the world. And indeed, \u201cif men were angels, no government would be necessary.\u201d But\nanarchic companies miss what James Madison saw: men aren\u2019t angels. That\u2019s why executives who\nmanage companies and directors who govern them have separate roles to play; it\u2019s also why\nfounders\u2019 and investors\u2019 claims on a company are formally defined. You need good people who get\nalong, but you also need a structure to help keep everyone aligned for the long term.\nTo anticipate likely sources of misalignment in any company, it\u2019s useful to distinguish between\nthree concepts:\n\u2022 Ownership: who legally owns a company\u2019s equity?\n\u2022 Possession: who actually runs the company on a day-to-day basis?\n\u2022 Control: who formally governs the company\u2019s affairs?\nA typical startup allocates ownership among founders, employees, and investors. The managers\nand employees who operate the company enjoy possession. And a board of directors, usually\ncomprising founders and investors, exercises control.\nIn theory, this division works smoothly. Financial upside from part ownership attracts and rewards\ninvestors and workers. Effective possession motivates and empowers founders and employees\u2014it\nmeans they can get stuff done. Oversight from the board places managers\u2019 plans in a broader\nperspective. In practice, distributing these functions among different people makes sense, but it also\nmultiplies opportunities for misalignment.\nTo see misalignment at its most extreme, just visit the DMV. Suppose you need a new driver\u2019s\nlicense. Theoretically, it should be easy to get one. The DMV is a government agency, and we live in\na democratic republic. All power resides in \u201cthe people,\u201d who elect representatives to serve them in\ngovernment. If you\u2019re a citizen, you\u2019re a part owner of the DMV and your representatives control it,\nso you should be able to walk in and get what you need.\nOf course, it doesn\u2019t work like that. We the people may \u201cown\u201d the DMV\u2019s resources, but that\nownership is merely fictional. The clerks and petty tyrants who operate the DMV, however, enjoy\nvery real possession of their small-time powers. Even the governor and the legislature charged with\nnominal control over the DMV can\u2019t change anything. The bureaucracy lurches ever sideways of its\nown inertia no matter what actions elected officials take. Accountable to nobody, the DMV is\nmisaligned with everybody. Bureaucrats can make your licensing experience pleasurable or\nnightmarish at their sole discretion. You can try to bring up political theory and remind them that you\nare the boss, but that\u2019s unlikely to get you better service.\nBig corporations do better than the DMV, but they\u2019re still prone to misalignment, especially\nbetween ownership and possession.

Whenever an entrepreneur\nasks me to invest in his company, I ask him how much he intends to pay himself. A company does\nbetter the less it pays the CEO\u2014that\u2019s one of the single clearest patterns I\u2019ve noticed from investing\nin hundreds of startups. In no case should a CEO of an early-stage, venture-backed startup receive\nmore than $150,000 per year in salary. It doesn\u2019t matter if he got used to making much more than that\nat Google or if he has a large mortgage and hefty private school tuition bills. If a CEO collects\n$300,000 per year, he risks becoming more like a politician than a founder. High pay incentivizes him\nto defend the status quo along with his salary, not to work with everyone else to surface problems and\nfix them aggressively. A cash-poor executive, by contrast, will focus on increasing the value of the\ncompany as a whole.\nLow CEO pay also sets the standard for everyone else. Aaron Levie, the CEO of Box, was always\ncareful to pay himself less than everyone else in the company\u2014four years after he started Box, he\nwas still living two blocks away from HQ in a one-bedroom apartment with no furniture except a\nmattress. Every employee noticed his obvious commitment to the company\u2019s mission and emulated it.\nIf a CEO doesn\u2019t set an example by taking the lowest salary in the company, he can do the same thing\nby drawing the highest salary. So long as that figure is still modest, it sets an effective ceiling on cash\ncompensation.\nCash is attractive. It offers pure optionality: once you get your paycheck, you can do anything you\nwant with it. However, high cash compensation teaches workers to claim value from the company as\nit already exists instead of investing their time to create new value in the future. A cash bonus is\nslightly better than a cash salary\u2014at least it\u2019s contingent on a job well done. But even so-called\nincentive pay encourages short-term thinking and value grabbing.

Equity is the one form of compensation that can effectively orient people toward\ncreating value in the future.\nHowever, for equity to create commitment rather than conflict, you must allocate it very carefully.\nGiving everyone equal shares is usually a mistake: every individual has different talents and\nresponsibilities as well as different opportunity costs, so equal amounts will seem arbitrary and\nunfair from the start. On the other hand, granting different amounts up front is just as sure to seem\nunfair. Resentment at this stage can kill a company, but there\u2019s no ownership formula to perfectly\navoid it.\nThis problem becomes even more acute over time as more people join the company. Early\nemployees usually get the most equity because they take more risk, but some later employees might be\neven more crucial to a venture\u2019s success. A secretary who joined eBay in 1996 might have made 200\ntimes more than her industry-veteran boss who joined in 1999. The graffiti artist who painted\nFacebook\u2019s office walls in 2005 got stock that turned out to be worth $200 million, while a talented\nengineer who joined in 2010 might have made only $2 million. Since it\u2019s impossible to achieve\nperfect fairness when distributing ownership, founders would do well to keep the details secret.\nSending out a company-wide email that lists everyone\u2019s ownership stake would be like dropping a\nnuclear bomb on your office.\nMost people don\u2019t want equity at all. At PayPal, we once hired a consultant who promised to help\nus negotiate lucrative business development deals. The only thing he ever successfully negotiated was\na $5,000 daily cash salary; he refused to accept stock options as payment. Stories of startup chefs\nbecoming millionaires notwithstanding, people often find equity unattractive. It\u2019s not liquid like cash.\nIt\u2019s tied to one specific company. And if that company doesn\u2019t succeed, it\u2019s worthless.\nEquity is a powerful tool precisely because of these limitations. Anyone who prefers owning a part\nof your company to being paid in cash reveals a preference for the long term and a commitment to\nincreasing your company\u2019s value in the future.

More than that,\ninternal peace is what enables a startup to survive at all. When a startup fails, we often imagine it\nsuccumbing to predatory rivals in a competitive ecosystem.

When they hear that\n3.2 million Americans work in sales, seasoned executives will suspect the number is low, but\nengineers may sigh in bewilderment. What could that many salespeople possibly be doing?\nIn Silicon Valley, nerds are skeptical of advertising, marketing, and sales because they seem\nsuperficial and irrational. But advertising matters because it works. It works on nerds, and it works\non you. You may think that you\u2019re an exception; that your preferences are authentic, and advertising\nonly works on other people. It\u2019s easy to resist the most obvious sales pitches, so we entertain a false\nconfidence in our own independence of mind. But advertising doesn\u2019t exist to make you buy a product\nright away; it exists to embed subtle impressions that will drive sales later. Anyone who can\u2019t\nacknowledge its likely effect on himself is doubly deceived.\nNerds are used to transparency. They add value by becoming expert at a technical skill like\ncomputer programming. In engineering disciplines, a solution either works or it fails. You can\nevaluate someone else\u2019s work with relative ease, as surface appearances don\u2019t matter much. Sales is\nthe opposite: an orchestrated campaign to change surface appearances without changing the\nunderlying reality. This strikes engineers as trivial if not fundamentally dishonest. They know their\nown jobs are hard, so when they look at salespeople laughing on the phone with a customer or going\nto two-hour lunches, they suspect that no real work is being done.

But we only react negatively to\nawkward, obvious salesmen\u2014that is, the bad ones. There\u2019s a wide range of sales ability: there are\nmany gradations between novices, experts, and masters. There are even sales grandmasters. If you\ndon\u2019t know any grandmasters, it\u2019s not because you haven\u2019t encountered them, but rather because their\nart is hidden in plain sight. Tom Sawyer managed to persuade his neighborhood friends to whitewash\nthe fence for him\u2014a masterful move. But convincing them to actually pay him for the privilege of\ndoing his chores was the move of a grandmaster, and his friends were none the wiser. Not much has\nchanged since Twain wrote in 1876.\nLike acting, sales works best when hidden. This explains why almost everyone whose job involves\ndistribution\u2014whether they\u2019re in sales, marketing, or advertising\u2014has a job title that has nothing to\ndo with those things. People who sell advertising are called \u201caccount executives.\u201d People who sell\ncustomers work in \u201cbusiness development.\u201d People who sell companies are \u201cinvestment bankers.\u201d\nAnd people who sell themselves are called \u201cpoliticians.\u201d There\u2019s a reason for these redescriptions:\nnone of us wants to be reminded when we\u2019re being sold.\nWhatever the career, sales ability distinguishes superstars from also-rans. On Wall Street, a new\nhire starts as an \u201canalyst\u201d wielding technical expertise, but his goal is to become a dealmaker. A\nlawyer prides himself on professional credentials, but law firms are led by the rainmakers who bring\nin big clients. Even university professors, who claim authority from scholarly achievement, are\nenvious of the self-promoters who define their fields. Academic ideas about history or English don\u2019t\njust sell themselves on their intellectual merits. Even the agenda of fundamental physics and the future\npath of cancer research are results of persuasion. The most fundamental reason that even\nbusinesspeople underestimate the importance of sales is the systematic effort to hide it at every level\nof every field in a world secretly driven by it.\nThe engineer\u2019s grail is a product great enough that \u201cit sells itself.\u201d But anyone who would actually\nsay this about a real product must be lying: either he\u2019s delusional (lying to himself) or he\u2019s selling\nsomething (and thereby contradicting himself). The polar opposite business clich\u00e9 warns that \u201cthe\nbest product doesn\u2019t always win.\u201d Economists attribute this to \u201cpath dependence\u201d: specific historical\ncircumstances independent of objective quality can determine which products enjoy widespread\nadoption. That\u2019s true, but it doesn\u2019t mean the operating systems we use today and the keyboard\nlayouts on which we type were imposed by mere chance. It\u2019s better to think of distribution as\nsomething essential to the design of your product.

No matter how strong your product\u2014even if it easily fits into already\nestablished habits and anybody who tries it likes it immediately\u2014you must still support it with a\nstrong distribution plan.\nTwo metrics set the limits for effective distribution. The total net profit that you earn on average\nover the course of your relationship with a customer (Customer Lifetime Value, or CLV) must exceed\nthe amount you spend on average to acquire a new customer (Customer Acquisition Cost, or CAC). In\ngeneral, the higher the price of your product, the more you have to spend to make a sale\u2014and the\nmore it makes sense to spend it. Distribution methods can be plotted on a continuum:\nComplex Sales\nIf your average sale is seven figures or more, every detail of every deal requires close personal\nattention. It might take months to develop the right relationships. You might make a sale only once\nevery year or two. Then you\u2019ll usually have to follow up during installation and service the product\nlong after the deal is done. It\u2019s hard to do, but this kind of \u201ccomplex sales\u201d is the only way to sell\nsome of the most valuable products.\nSpaceX shows that it can be done. Within just a few years of launching his rocket startup, Elon\nMusk persuaded NASA to sign billion-dollar contracts to replace the decommissioned space shuttle\nwith a newly designed vessel from SpaceX. Politics matters in big deals just as much as\ntechnological ingenuity, so this wasn\u2019t easy. SpaceX employs more than 3,000 people, mostly in\nCalifornia. The traditional U.S. aerospace industry employs more than 500,000 people, spread\nthroughout all 50 states. Unsurprisingly, members of Congress don\u2019t want to give up federal funds\ngoing to their home districts. But since complex sales requires making just a few deals each year, a\nsales grandmaster like Elon Musk can use that time to focus on the most crucial people\u2014and even to\novercome political inertia.\nComplex sales works best when you don\u2019t have \u201csalesmen\u201d at all. Palantir, the data analytics\ncompany I co-founded with my law school classmate Alex Karp, doesn\u2019t employ anyone separately\ntasked with selling its product. Instead, Alex, who is Palantir\u2019s CEO, spends 25 days a month on the\nroad, meeting with clients and potential clients. Our deal sizes range from $1 million to $100 million.\nAt that price point, buyers want to talk to the CEO, not the VP of Sales.\nBusinesses with complex sales models succeed if they achieve 50% to 100% year-over-year\ngrowth over the course of a decade.

Once you have a pool of\nreference customers who are successfully using your product, then you can begin the long and\nmethodical work of hustling toward ever bigger deals.\nPersonal Sales\nMost sales are not particularly complex: average deal sizes might range between $10,000 and\n$100,000, and usually the CEO won\u2019t have to do all the selling himself. The challenge here isn\u2019t\nabout how to make any particular sale, but how to establish a process by which a sales team of\nmodest size can move the product to a wide audience.\nIn 2008, Box had a good way for companies to store their data safely and accessibly in the cloud.\nBut people didn\u2019t know they needed such a thing\u2014cloud computing hadn\u2019t caught on yet. That\nsummer, Blake was hired as Box\u2019s third salesperson to help change that. Starting with small groups of\nusers who had the most acute file sharing problems, Box\u2019s sales reps built relationships with more\nand more users in each client company. In 2009, Blake sold a small Box account to the Stanford Sleep\nClinic, where researchers needed an easy, secure way to store experimental data logs. Today the\nuniversity offers a Stanford-branded Box account to every one of its students and faculty members,\nand Stanford Hospital runs on Box. If it had started off by trying to sell the president of the university\non an enterprise-wide solution, Box would have sold nothing. A complex sales approach would have\nmade Box a forgotten startup failure; instead, personal sales made it a multibillion-dollar business.\nSometimes the product itself is a kind of distribution. ZocDoc is a Founders Fund portfolio\ncompany that helps people find and book medical appointments online. The company charges doctors\na few hundred dollars per month to be included in its network. With an average deal size of just a few\nthousand dollars, ZocDoc needs lots of salespeople\u2014so many that they have an internal recruiting\nteam to do nothing but hire more. But making personal sales to doctors doesn\u2019t just bring in revenue;\nby adding doctors to the network, salespeople make the product more valuable to consumers (and\nmore consumer users increases its appeal to doctors). More than 5 million people already use the\nservice each month, and if it can continue to scale its network to include a majority of practitioners, it\nwill become a fundamental utility for the U.S. health care industry.\nDistribution Doldrums\nIn between personal sales (salespeople obviously required) and traditional advertising (no\nsalespeople required) there is a dead zone. Suppose you create a software service that helps\nconvenience store owners track their inventory and manage ordering. For a product priced around\n$1,000, there might be no good distribution channel to reach the small businesses that might buy it.\nEven if you have a clear value proposition, how do you get people to hear it? Advertising would\neither be too broad (there\u2019s no TV channel that only convenience store owners watch) or too\ninefficient (on its own, an ad in Convenience Store News probably won\u2019t convince any owner to part\nwith $1,000 a year). The product needs a personal sales effort, but at that price point, you simply\ndon\u2019t have the resources to send an actual person to talk to every prospective customer.

The company states plainly on its website that \u201cTV is a great big megaphone,\u201d\nand when you can only afford to spend dozens of dollars acquiring a new customer, you need the\nbiggest megaphone you can find.\nEvery entrepreneur envies a recognizable ad campaign, but startups should resist the temptation to\ncompete with bigger companies in the endless contest to put on the most memorable TV spots or the\nmost elaborate PR stunts. I know this from experience. At PayPal we hired James Doohan, who\nplayed Scotty on Star Trek, to be our official spokesman. When we released our first software for the\nPalmPilot, we invited journalists to an event where they could hear James recite this immortal line:\n\u201cI\u2019ve been beaming people up my whole career, but this is the first time I\u2019ve ever been able to beam\nmoney!\u201d It flopped\u2014the few who actually came to cover the event weren\u2019t impressed. We were all\nnerds, so we had thought Scotty the Chief Engineer could speak with more authority than, say, Captain\nKirk. (Just like a salesman, Kirk was always showboating out in some exotic locale and leaving it up\nto the engineers to bail him out of his own mistakes.) We were wrong: when Priceline.com cast\nWilliam Shatner (the actor who played Kirk) in a famous series of TV spots, it worked for them. But\nby then Priceline was a major player. No early-stage startup can match big companies\u2019 advertising\nbudgets. Captain Kirk truly is in a league of his own.\nViral Marketing\nA product is viral if its core functionality encourages users to invite their friends to become users too.\nThis is how Facebook and PayPal both grew quickly: every time someone shares with a friend or\nmakes a payment, they naturally invite more and more people into the network. This isn\u2019t just cheap\u2014\nit\u2019s fast, too. If every new user leads to more than one additional user, you can achieve a chain\nreaction of exponential growth. The ideal viral loop should be as quick and frictionless as possible.\nFunny YouTube videos or internet memes get millions of views very quickly because they have", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3576, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d97b1ca-1df3-490a-9332-2032965ddb20": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d97b1ca-1df3-490a-9332-2032965ddb20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 160, "file_path": "src/data/zero-to-one.pdf", "source": "101", "chapter": "How To Sell A Product", "chapter_title": "How To Sell A Product", "page_number": "101"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "625e84ee-5986-4e1c-a8f5-4a7427bd6897", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"total_pages": 160, "file_path": "src/data/zero-to-one.pdf", "source": "101", "chapter": "How To Sell A Product", "chapter_title": "How To Sell A Product", "page_number": "101"}, "hash": "648acdc744603987441b7fae005a2a39b51423447b03119c8b1905c7d195d32f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "extremely short cycle times: people see the kitten, feel warm inside, and forward it to their friends in\na matter of seconds.\nA t PayPal, our initial user base was 24 people, all of whom worked at PayPal. Acquiring\ncustomers through banner advertising proved too expensive. However, by directly paying people to\nsign up and then paying them more to refer friends, we achieved extraordinary growth. This strategy\ncost us $20 per customer, but it also led to 7% daily growth, which meant that our user base nearly\ndoubled every 10 days. After four or five months, we had hundreds of thousands of users and a viable\nopportunity to build a great company by servicing money transfers for small fees that ended up greatly\nexceeding our customer acquisition cost.\nWhoever is first to dominate the most important segment of a market with viral potential will be the\nlast mover in the whole market. At PayPal we didn\u2019t want to acquire more users at random; we\nwanted to get the most valuable users first. The most obvious market segment in email-based\npayments was the millions of emigrants still using Western Union to wire money to their families\nback home. Our product made that effortless, but the transactions were too infrequent. We needed a\nsmaller niche market segment with a higher velocity of money\u2014a segment we found in eBay\n\u201cPowerSellers,\u201d the professional vendors who sold goods online through eBay\u2019s auction\nmarketplace. There were 20,000 of them. Most had multiple auctions ending each day, and they\nbought almost as much as they sold, which meant a constant stream of payments. And because eBay\u2019s\nown solution to the payment problem was terrible, these merchants were extremely enthusiastic early\nadopters. Once PayPal dominated this segment and became the payments platform for eBay, there\nwas no catching up\u2014on eBay or anywhere else.\nThe Power Law of Distribution\nOne of these methods is likely to be far more powerful than every other for any given business:\ndistribution follows a power law of its own. This is counterintuitive for most entrepreneurs, who\nassume that more is more. But the kitchen sink approach\u2014employ a few salespeople, place some\nmagazine ads, and try to add some kind of viral functionality to the product as an afterthought\u2014\ndoesn\u2019t work. Most businesses get zero distribution channels to work: poor sales rather than bad\nproduct is the most common cause of failure. If you can get just one distribution channel to work, you\nhave a great business. If you try for several but don\u2019t nail one, you\u2019re finished.\nSelling to Non-Customers\nYour company needs to sell more than its product. You must also sell your company to employees and\ninvestors. There is a \u201chuman resources\u201d version of the lie that great products sell themselves: \u201cThis\ncompany is so good that people will be clamoring to join it.\u201d And there\u2019s a fundraising version too:\n\u201cThis company is so great that investors will be banging down our door to invest.\u201d Clamor and frenzy\nare very real, but they rarely happen without calculated recruiting and pitching beneath the surface.\nSelling your company to the media is a necessary part of selling it to everyone else. Nerds who\ninstinctively mistrust the media often make the mistake of trying to ignore it. But just as you can never\nexpect people to buy a superior product merely on its obvious merits without any distribution\nstrategy, you should never assume that people will admire your company without a public relations\nstrategy.

COMPLEMENTARITY\nFifteen years ago, American workers were worried about competition from cheaper Mexican\nsubstitutes. And that made sense, because humans really can substitute for each other. Today people\nthink they can hear Ross Perot\u2019s \u201cgiant sucking sound\u201d once more, but they trace it back to server\nfarms somewhere in Texas instead of cut-rate factories in Tijuana. Americans fear technology in the\nnear future because they see it as a replay of the globalization of the near past. But the situations are\nvery different: people compete for jobs and for resources; computers compete for neither.\nGlobalization Means Substitution\nWhen Perot warned about foreign competition, both George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton preached the\ngospel of free trade: since every person has a relative strength at some particular job, in theory the\neconomy maximizes wealth when people specialize according to their advantages and then trade with\neach other. In practice, it\u2019s not unambiguously clear how well free trade has worked, for many\nworkers at least. Gains from trade are greatest when there\u2019s a big discrepancy in comparative\nadvantage, but the global supply of workers willing to do repetitive tasks for an extremely small\nwage is extremely large.\nPeople don\u2019t just compete to supply labor; they also demand the same resources. While American\nconsumers have benefited from access to cheap toys and textiles from China, they\u2019ve had to pay\nhigher prices for the gasoline newly desired by millions of Chinese motorists. Whether people eat\nshark fins in Shanghai or fish tacos in San Diego, they all need food and they all need shelter. And\ndesire doesn\u2019t stop at subsistence\u2014people will demand ever more as globalization continues. Now\nthat millions of Chinese peasants can finally enjoy a secure supply of basic calories, they want more\nof them to come from pork instead of just grain. The convergence of desire is even more obvious at\nthe top: all oligarchs have the same taste in Cristal, from Petersburg to Pyongyang.\nTechnology Means Complementarity\nNow think about the prospect of competition from computers instead of competition from human\nworkers. On the supply side, computers are far more different from people than any two people are\ndifferent from each other: men and machines are good at fundamentally different things. People have\nintentionality\u2014we form plans and make decisions in complicated situations. We\u2019re less good at\nmaking sense of enormous amounts of data. Computers are exactly the opposite: they excel at efficient\ndata processing, but they struggle to make basic judgments that would be simple for any human.\nTo understand the scale of this variance, consider another of Google\u2019s computer-for-human\nsubstitution projects. In 2012, one of their supercomputers made headlines when, after scanning 10\nmillion thumbnails of YouTube videos, it learned to identify a cat with 75% accuracy. That seems\nimpressive\u2014until you remember that an average four-year-old can do it flawlessly. When a cheap\nlaptop beats the smartest mathematicians at some tasks but even a supercomputer with 16,000 CPUs\ncan\u2019t beat a child at others, you can tell that humans and computers are not just more or less powerful\nthan each other\u2014they\u2019re categorically different.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3276, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e63961d1-f2df-45c3-a554-553cf37128c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "e63961d1-f2df-45c3-a554-553cf37128c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 160, "file_path": "src/data/zero-to-one.pdf", "source": "107", "chapter": "Substitution Vs.

It\u2019s also the path to\nbuilding a great business. I came to understand this from my experience at PayPal. In mid-2000, we\nhad survived the dot-com crash and we were growing fast, but we faced one huge problem: we were\nlosing upwards of $10 million to credit card fraud every month. Since we were processing hundreds\nor even thousands of transactions per minute, we couldn\u2019t possibly review each one\u2014no human\nquality control team could work that fast.\nSo we did what any group of engineers would do: we tried to automate a solution. First, Max\nLevchin assembled an elite team of mathematicians to study the fraudulent transfers in detail. Then we\ntook what we learned and wrote software to automatically identify and cancel bogus transactions in\nreal time. But it quickly became clear that this approach wouldn\u2019t work either: after an hour or two,\nthe thieves would catch on and change their tactics. We were dealing with an adaptive enemy, and our\nsoftware couldn\u2019t adapt in response.\nThe fraudsters\u2019 adaptive evasions fooled our automatic detection algorithms, but we found that they\ndidn\u2019t fool our human analysts as easily. So Max and his engineers rewrote the software to take a\nhybrid approach: the computer would flag the most suspicious transactions on a well-designed user\ninterface, and human operators would make the final judgment as to their legitimacy. Thanks to this\nhybrid system\u2014we named it \u201cIgor,\u201d after the Russian fraudster who bragged that we\u2019d never be able\nto stop him\u2014we turned our first quarterly profit in the first quarter of 2002 (as opposed to a quarterly\nloss of $29.3 million one year before). The FBI asked us if we\u2019d let them use Igor to help detect\nfinancial crime. And Max was able to boast, grandiosely but truthfully, that he was \u201cthe Sherlock\nHolmes of the Internet Underground.\u201d\nThis kind of man-machine symbiosis enabled PayPal to stay in business, which in turn enabled\nhundreds of thousands of small businesses to accept the payments they needed to thrive on the\ninternet. None of it would have been possible without the man-machine solution\u2014even though most\npeople would never see it or even hear about it.\nI continued to think about this after we sold PayPal in 2002: if humans and computers together\ncould achieve dramatically better results than either could attain alone, what other valuable\nbusinesses could be built on this core principle? The next year, I pitched Alex Karp, an old Stanford\nclassmate, and Stephen Cohen, a software engineer, on a new startup idea: we would use the human-\ncomputer hybrid approach from PayPal\u2019s security system to identify terrorist networks and financial\nfraud. We already knew the FBI was interested, and in 2004 we founded Palantir, a software\ncompany that helps people extract insight from divergent sources of information. The company is on\ntrack to book sales of $1 billion in 2014, and Forbes has called Palantir\u2019s software the \u201ckiller app\u201d\nfor its rumored role in helping the government locate Osama bin Laden.\nWe have no details to share from that operation, but we can say that neither human intelligence by\nitself nor computers alone will be able to make us safe. America\u2019s two biggest spy agencies take\nopposite approaches: The Central Intelligence Agency is run by spies who privilege humans.

The\ncompany sought to \u201ccreate a green alternative that would lessen our dependence on highly polluting\ntransportation technologies.\u201d And it did just that\u2014at least by 1,000 cars, the number it sold before\nfiling for bankruptcy. Even selling that many was an achievement, because each of those cars was\nvery hard for customers to buy.\nFor starters, it was never clear what you were actually buying. Better Place bought sedans from\nRenault and refitted them with electric batteries and electric motors. So, were you buying an electric\nRenault, or were you buying a Better Place? In any case, if you decided to buy one, you had to jump\nthrough a series of hoops. First, you needed to seek approval from Better Place. To get that, you had\nto prove that you lived close enough to a Better Place battery swapping station and promise to follow\npredictable routes. If you passed that test, you had to sign up for a fueling subscription in order to\nrecharge your car.

Cleantech\nentrepreneurs would have done well to rephrase the durability question and ask: what will stop China\nfrom wiping out my business? Without an answer, the result shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise.\nBeyond the failure to anticipate competition in manufacturing the same green products, cleantech\nembraced misguided assumptions about the energy market as a whole. An industry premised on the\nsupposed twilight of fossil fuels was blindsided by the rise of fracking. In 2000, just 1.7% of\nAmerica\u2019s natural gas came from fracked shale. Five years later, that figure had climbed to 4.1%.\nNevertheless, nobody in cleantech took this trend seriously: renewables were the only way forward;\nfossil fuels couldn\u2019t possibly get cheaper or cleaner in the future. But they did. By 2013, shale gas\naccounted for 34% of America\u2019s natural gas, and gas prices had fallen more than 70% since 2008,\ndevastating most renewable energy business models.

They rode the\nsocial buzz of cleantech better than anyone, but they got the seven questions right, so their success is\ninstructive:\nTECHNOLOGY. Tesla\u2019s technology is so good that other car companies rely on it: Daimler uses Tesla\u2019s\nbattery packs; Mercedes-Benz uses a Tesla powertrain; Toyota uses a Tesla motor. General\nMotors has even created a task force to track Tesla\u2019s next moves. But Tesla\u2019s greatest\ntechnological achievement isn\u2019t any single part or component, but rather its ability to integrate\nmany components into one superior product. The Tesla Model S sedan, elegantly designed from\nend to end, is more than the sum of its parts: Consumer Reports rated it higher than any other car\never reviewed, and both Motor Trend and Automobile magazines named it their 2013 Car of the\nYear.\nTIMING. In 2009, it was easy to think that the government would continue to support cleantech:\n\u201cgreen jobs\u201d were a political priority, federal funds were already earmarked, and Congress\neven seemed likely to pass cap-and-trade legislation. But where others saw generous subsidies\nthat could flow indefinitely, Tesla CEO Elon Musk rightly saw a one-time-only opportunity. In\nJanuary 2010\u2014about a year and a half before Solyndra imploded under the Obama\nadministration and politicized the subsidy question\u2014Tesla secured a $465 million loan from the\nU.S. Department of Energy. A half-billion-dollar subsidy was unthinkable in the mid-2000s. It\u2019s\nunthinkable today. There was only one moment where that was possible, and Tesla played it\nperfectly.\nMONOPOLY. Tesla started with a tiny submarket that it could dominate: the market for high-end electric\nsports cars. Since the first Roadster rolled off the production line in 2008, Tesla\u2019s sold only\nabout 3,000 of them, but at $109,000 apiece that\u2019s not trivial. Starting small allowed Tesla to\nundertake the necessary R&D to build the slightly less expensive Model S, and now Tesla owns\nthe luxury electric sedan market, too. They sold more than 20,000 sedans in 2013 and now Tesla\nis in prime position to expand to broader markets in the future.\nTEAM. Tesla\u2019s CEO is the consummate engineer and salesman, so it\u2019s not surprising that he\u2019s\nassembled a team that\u2019s very good at both. Elon describes his staff this way: \u201cIf you\u2019re at Tesla,\nyou\u2019re choosing to be at the equivalent of Special Forces. There\u2019s the regular army, and that\u2019s\nfine, but if you are working at Tesla, you\u2019re choosing to step up your game.\u201d\nDISTRIBUTION. Most companies underestimate distribution, but Tesla took it so seriously that it decided\nto own the entire distribution chain. Other car companies are beholden to independent\ndealerships: Ford and Hyundai make cars, but they rely on other people to sell them. Tesla sells\nand services its vehicles in its own stores. The up-front costs of Tesla\u2019s approach are much\nhigher than traditional dealership distribution, but it affords control over the customer\nexperience, strengthens Tesla\u2019s brand, and saves the company money in the long run.\nDURABILITY.

Energy is the master resource:\nit\u2019s how we feed ourselves, build shelter, and make everything we need to live comfortably. Most of\nthe world dreams of living as comfortably as Americans do today, and globalization will cause\nincreasingly severe energy challenges unless we build new technology. There simply aren\u2019t enough\nresources in the world to replicate old approaches or redistribute our way to prosperity.\nCleantech gave people a way to be optimistic about the future of energy.

Plot the valuation of alternative energy firms\nin the 2000s alongside the NASDAQ\u2019s rise and fall a decade before, and you see the same shape:\nThe 1990s had one big idea: the internet is going to be big. But too many internet companies had\nexactly that same idea and no others. An entrepreneur can\u2019t benefit from macro-scale insight unless\nhis own plans begin at the micro-scale. Cleantech companies faced the same problem: no matter how\nmuch the world needs energy, only a firm that offers a superior solution for a specific energy problem\ncan make money. No sector will ever be so important that merely participating in it will be enough to\nbuild a great company.\nThe tech bubble was far bigger than cleantech and the crash even more painful. But the dream of\nthe \u201990s turned out to be right: skeptics who doubted that the internet would fundamentally change\npublishing or retail sales or everyday social life looked prescient in 2001, but they seem comically\nfoolish today. Could successful energy startups be founded after the cleantech crash just as Web 2.0\nstartups successfully launched amid the debris of the dot-coms?

Classical mythology is full of them. Oedipus is\nthe paradigmatic insider/outsider: he was abandoned as an infant and ended up in a foreign land, but\nhe was a brilliant king and smart enough to solve the riddle of the Sphinx.\nRomulus and Remus were born of royal blood and abandoned as orphans. When they discovered\ntheir pedigree, they decided to found a city. But they couldn\u2019t agree on where to put it. When Remus\ncrossed the boundary that Romulus had decided was the edge of Rome, Romulus killed him,\ndeclaring: \u201cSo perish every one that shall hereafter leap over my wall.\u201d Law-maker and law-breaker,\ncriminal outlaw and king who defined Rome, Romulus was a self-contradictory insider/outsider.\nNormal people aren\u2019t like Oedipus or Romulus. Whatever those individuals were actually like in\nlife, the mythologized versions of them remember only the extremes. But why was it so important for\narchaic cultures to remember extraordinary people?\nThe famous and infamous have always served as vessels for public sentiment: they\u2019re praised amid\nprosperity and blamed for misfortune. Primitive societies faced one fundamental problem above all:\nthey would be torn apart by conflict if they didn\u2019t have a way to stop it. So whenever plagues,\ndisasters, or violent rivalries threatened the peace, it was beneficial for the society to place the entire\nblame on a single person, someone everybody could agree on: a scapegoat.\nWho makes an effective scapegoat? Like founders, scapegoats are extreme and contradictory\nfigures. On the one hand, a scapegoat is necessarily weak; he is powerless to stop his own\nvictimization. On the other hand, as the one who can defuse conflict by taking the blame, he is the\nmost powerful member of the community.\nBefore execution, scapegoats were often worshipped like deities. The Aztecs considered their\nvictims to be earthly forms of the gods to whom they were sacrificed.

However, in case of extinction, there is no human future of any kind to consider.\nIf we define the future as a time that looks different from the present, then most people aren\u2019t\nexpecting any future at all; instead, they expect coming decades to bring more globalization,\nconvergence, and sameness. In this scenario, poorer countries will catch up to richer countries, and\nthe world as a whole will reach an economic plateau. But even if a truly globalized plateau were\npossible, could it last? In the best case, economic competition would be more intense than ever\nbefore for every single person and firm on the planet.\nHowever, when you add competition to consume scarce resources, it\u2019s hard to see how a global\nplateau could last indefinitely. Without new technology to relieve competitive pressures, stagnation is\nlikely to erupt into conflict. In case of conflict on a global scale, stagnation collapses into extinction.\nThat leaves the fourth scenario, in which we create new technology to make a much better future.\nThe most dramatic version of this outcome is called the Singularity, an attempt to name the imagined\nresult of new technologies so powerful as to transcend the current limits of our understanding.

What the\nSingularity would look like matters less than the stark choice we face today between the two most\nlikely scenarios: nothing or something. It\u2019s up to us. We cannot take for granted that the future will be\nbetter, and that means we need to work to create it today.\nWhether we achieve the Singularity on a cosmic scale is perhaps less important than whether we\nseize the unique opportunities we have to do new things in our own working lives.
